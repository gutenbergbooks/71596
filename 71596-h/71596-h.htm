<p>“You do, indeed, know a great deal about
uncle,” wrote Whittier’s niece, Mrs. Pickard,
to the writer.</p>

<p>In the middle 1830’s Whittier with his
mother, her sister “Aunt Mercy,” and his sister
Elizabeth, “our youngest and our dearest” of
“Snow Bound” memories, removed from his
birthplace in Haverhill to the Amesbury home
which grew to be so dear to him.</p>

<p>His townspeople held him in admiration and
loving reverence. Some came to his home as
honored citizens enter a city made free to them,
and learned that his life was poetry no less than
his writings.</p>

<p>In 1887 he said in a letter to the writer: “I
think often of the old days when thy father was
alive and sister Lizzie and we were all together.”</p>

<p>As the daughter of his physician and friend,
she has given in “Whittier at Close Range”
intimate glimpses of his life and character.</p>

[Illustration]

<p>In the garden room, worthy synonym of
a poet’s study where blossom flowers of thought
and beauty, a young neighbor of the poet
awaited his coming.</p>

<p>His easy chair stood with bookshelves on
the right hand, whence he could gather from
them as he pleased—although books were
scattered everywhere over the house—and
at its left was the table between the windows
looking into the garden, while opposite it
stood the door from the little hall, so that
the chair faced all who entered the room.
She looked across the room at a painting of
a California sunset—Starr King’s gift to the
poet. Near the painting was the engraving
of an Arctic scene sent to the poet and his
sister Elizabeth by Dr. Kane on his return
from his Arctic explorations. She remembered
how for a long time the picture had
failed to appear, and how when a duplicate
had been sent and hung, this first picture had
at last arrived, and had been given by Miss
Whittier to one of her Amesbury friends.</p>

<p>The poet had banished from the garden room
a fine oil painting of himself in his youth, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
striking portrait, full of individuality, yet
bearing a suggestion of Burns. But it was not
strange that one poet should recall the other,
since there was in some respects a marked
resemblance in the moods and ideals of the
two; while in character and life they were
as far asunder as the poles.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Whittier’s poem on “Burns,” written
“On Receiving a Sprig of Heather in Blossom,”
was published, his sister Elizabeth wrote to
the doctor’s wife, “This song of Burns was
written partly before, but thy gift of heather
bells has given it all its beauty. Nobody knows
how much I love the old romance of Scotland,
and the name of <i>heather</i> or <i>moorland</i> always
has a charm.” Later, the poet himself told
the giver—a Scotswoman—of his early falling
in with the poems of Burns, and how the
Scottish poet had opened his eyes to the beauty
of the simplicities of life and our rich possession
in these, and how, taught by Burns, Whittier
had</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Matched with Scotland’s heathery hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sweetbrier and the clover.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All his life Whittier saw and taught</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The unsung beauty hid life’s common things below.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>
<p>What compensation to him for the limitations
which his life work for the slave and his
own delicate health imposed upon him! In
proclaiming the slave his brother, Whittier
came to perceive his own brotherhood with
all men bound in whatever slavery of mind
and soul, to see that simplicity and reality
were the great forces of life and inspiration
in poetry as in all other things. His own
early instructions prepared him for Burns’
assertion,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A man’s a man for a’that.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And from Burns’ most beautiful song Whittier
sings,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With clearer eyes I saw the worth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of life among the lowly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Bible at his cotter’s hearth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Has made my own more holy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These dreams and perceptions made him
the poet of New England idyls, as did his
spiritual inspiration of her ideals. He looked
with anointed eyes upon her woods and fields,
her hills and streams and her rocky coast.
It was first through Burns and then through
his own life that he sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yet on life’s current, he who drifts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is one with him who rows or sails;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he who wanders widest lifts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No more of beauty’s jealous veils</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than he who from his doorway sees</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The miracle of flowers and trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Feels the warm Orient in the noonday air</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And from cloud minaret hears the sunset call to prayer!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He sings the beauty in brooks and fields, the
oneness that pervades all nature, and how to
the opened eyes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From his lone sweetbrier Persian Hafiz smiles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Rome’s cathedral awe is in his woodland aisles.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This world of beauty in everyday life Whittier
has revealed to those who do not travel; he has
opened their eyes to perceive how great are
their possessions, not in the far-away, nor in
the future, but here and now. Other poets may
arouse longings for the unattainable; but Whittier
has shown us how the manna of life lies at
our own doors waiting for us to gather. Burns
with inspired lyre sings of the daisy and the
mouse, of the Doon and the Ayr, of men and of his
“Highland Mary.” Whittier sings of flower
and tree and field, of mountain and river, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
men and women. But over all his pictures
arches the depth of the sky giving them perspective
and illumination. When he sings of
the sea,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The ocean looketh up to God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As ’twere a living thing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The homage of its waves is given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In ceaseless worshipping.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And of life’s trials,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... darkness in the pathway of man’s life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is but the shadow of God’s providence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the great Sun of Wisdom cast thereon.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To his ears is attuned the music heard through
the silences, how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The harp at Nature’s advent strung</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Has never ceased to play;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The songs the stars of morning sung</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Has never died away.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before his eyes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The green earth sends her incense up;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">and to his vision,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The mists above the morning rills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rise white as wings of prayer;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">to him</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The blue sky is the temple’s arch.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What poet paints nature with a truer touch
than he? To him the universe is one thought
of God; to him all Nature is informed, not as
by the many gods of Polytheism; but by a
reverent Monotheism, by the touch of the All-Father
and the response of a sentient world.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So Nature keeps the reverent frame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With which her years began,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all her signs and voices shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The prayerless heart of man.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What artist ever drew with brush a more
perfect picture of midsummer heat than Whittier
in his prelude to the poem, “Among the
Hills”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The sky is hot and hazy, and the wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wing-weary with its long flight from the south, Unfelt.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the sharp call of the locust stabbing
“the noon-silence;” the driver asleep on his
haycart; the sheep huddled against the shade
of the stone-wall; and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“Through the open door</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A drowsy smell of flowers—grey heliotrope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And white sweet clover, and shy mignonette—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comes faintly in, and silent chorus lends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the pervading symphony of peace.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The eyes of the visitor in the garden room
fell upon the couch standing under the sunset
view, and she recalled how many famous persons
had sat upon it—Emerson, “his Puritanic face
with more than Eastern wisdom lit;” and
Bayard Taylor; for she knew of his long and
intimate friendship with the poet and his sister,
a friendship terminating only with death—if,
indeed, Whittier’s friendships have ever terminated;
for he seemed to reflect the eternity
of Heaven in a heart that never forgot to love.
And Sumner had been there—Sumner who with
every gift that men prize had turned aside from
them all to fight the battle of the slave—“has
he not graced my home with beauty all his own?”
sang the poet. And many more than these.
“What loved ones enter and depart,” recorded
Whittier.</p>

<p>The books at hand; the desk beside the long
window looking out upon the veranda were
evidences of Whittier’s life work and preparation
to meet scholar and statesman upon their own
grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Near the desk stood the hospitable-throated
Franklin stove. What wit and wisdom glowed
in the light of its winter fires! And what wonderful
closet was that in the garden room. Here
the poet kept his wood—and much else besides!
For, from it would he come forth armed with
his logs and with the wizard-like power to read
the thoughts of his companion! And this skill
he proved as he sat before the fire and talked in
fun or in earnest, often alternating in mood,
but always illuminating the subjects he talked
upon.</p>

<p>And in the summer days what a background
the blackness of the open stove made for the
flower treasures which the poet brought from
his walks! Then, suddenly, the visitor wondered
why there were no flowers upon the hearth that
August day?</p>

<p>But even with the thought, the poet came into
the room with his arms filled with flowers.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>


<p>As he showed them to her, she touched a spray
of the goldenrod. “The signal of autumn—Dame
Nature’s first grey hair,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thee’s about right there,” he answered.
“And what does thee call that?” And his deft
fingers singled out another flower.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The pale aster in the brook,” she quoted.</p>
</div>

<p>He laughed, and went out of the room to put
the flowers into water, but not before she had
commented upon the splendid cardinal flowers
scattered among the asters, and the brilliant
sumach leaves and spikes which made a background
in the gorgeous mass of color.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whittier’s poems are rich in descriptions of
flowers, and he sang of them as only one who
loved them could do:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For ages on our river borders,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These tassels in their tawny bloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And willowy studs of downy silver,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Have prophesied of Spring to come,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">he says of the beloved pussy-willows which open
the floral ball of the year among the wild flowers
of New England. For the trailing arbutus, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
exquisite mayflower, “tinted like a shell,” he
has many a word. And he knows the flowers,
all of them, from the bloom of the “summer
roses,” to where in the August heat,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Heavy with sunshine droops the goldenrod,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the red pennons of the cardinal flowers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hang motionless upon their upright staves;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">to the late autumn where,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“... on a ground of sombre fir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And azure-studded juniper,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The silver birch its buds of purple shows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And scarlet berries tell where bloomed the sweet wild-rose!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again to the very latest blossom,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Last of their floral sisterhood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hazel’s yellow blossoms shine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tawny gold of Afric’s mine!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, throughout the year bloom and brightness,
fragrance and beauty find their records in the
songs of the poet. “What airs outblown from
ferny dells!” he exclaims in his “Last Walk in
Autumn” where he treads as if a painter’s brush
were in his hand, bringing to the reader’s eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
“winter’s dazzling morns” and “sunset lights”
and “moonlit snows,” to atone for the loss of
summer bloom and greenness.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whittier took great pride in the beauty and
diversity of the flora of his own Essex County;
he used to say that it was the richest and most
varied of the region. He wrote more than one
poem to celebrate autumn festivals in his own
town.</p>

<p>In his walks with his sister in her later years,
as he writes of her, “too frail and weak” to go
herself in search of the flowers she longed for,
he would make her rest upon a rock or grassy
bank and alone would search for the treasures
of wood and field of which both were so fond.</p>

<p>One day when returning from Boston to
Amesbury he met a young friend of his on the
train. As the two were talking together, a boy
selling water lilies passed through the car. The
poet bought a bunch of them and gave to his
companion. As they sat looking at the exquisite
flowers, he said to her: “Thee’d hardly think
that the same Hand that made those made
snakes.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That August day while the flowers glowed in
the throat of the Franklin stove, converting
blackness into splendor, the poet sat in his arm-chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
telling his visitor somewhat of the book
into which she had peeped while waiting for
him; telling her also of other books, and of
people and things.</p>

<p>In the talk and laughter that followed he
spoke of Dickens, of whose writings the poet
was very fond, declaring that he was never so
restless, or so troubled over politics, or so blue
about himself, or the weather, that he could not
have a good laugh over “Pickwick.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As the poet sat that day beside his books,
with the light from the window falling upon
him, he looked, as he was, a man among ten
thousand. Tall, erect, as he was even to the
last, full of the nervous energy that found ready
expression in glance and gesture, his head a
remarkable height from ear to crown, domelike,
built for brains and spiritual power; his eyes
radiant at times with the fire of his soul and
having the rare capacity both to absorb and to
express everything; his heavy eyebrows delighting
in swift accompaniments to the humorous
twists of his mouth as he told a droll story, or
in pain or in moods of despondency dropped
down to conceal the eyes that all too plainly
revealed how things were in the soul. His
whole look was alert, as that of a man whom
the last new thing can never surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>After a time the poet searched the table for
a book he had left there. His visitor explained
that a neighbor had come in and borrowed
it. “She said you had so many books, you
wouldn’t miss it,” added the speaker.</p>

<p>Down came Whittier’s hand upon his knee
in the fashion so well known to his intimates;
for his hands might have been called almost
another feature, such emphasis did they give
to his expression.</p>

<p>“I was in the midst of reading it myself,”
he retorted. “I wish she had taken something
else to amuse her; she won’t care for it; I
could have helped her out better in a book.
But she is satisfied.” And his infectious laugh
was echoed by his hearer.</p>

<p>For Whittier never forgot how precious books
had been to him in his childhood and early
youth; and how he had hungered for them.
And now that he had them in abundance, he
so gladly shared them with his friends that
these had the habit of coming in and, if he
happened to be away, of helping themselves
to whatever they wanted to borrow; so that
the poet would often search about for a book
that he himself wished to lend and, not finding
it, would remark resignedly that he guessed
somebody had come in and taken it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>How natural and true was his life—that
simple life so much praised at present, and so
little lived! How unfettered by ceremony
and the impedimenta of pomp was the genius
which awoke the country by its ringing songs
of freedom, and at the same time with a skill
and statesmanship which the best politicians
acknowledged and were glad to profit by, helped
to build up the great party which destroyed
slavery, saved the Union, and in spite of its
grievous later faults, may well be proud of its
record and its continued accomplishments.</p>

<p>How simple was the home in which so much
that was grand and permanent was accomplished!
For in the garden room great plans
were formulated—yes, and the spirit to execute
them inspired—great poems were sung, and
there were born great thoughts that have
helped to move the world onward and Heavenward.
How ready was the many-sided Whittier
to welcome all phases of human nature but
the evil, and in his abhorrence of evil still to
pity the evildoers! His neighbors and friends
never forgot that he was a great man,
with power that had a long arm and fame
that reached across the water—a longer distance
then than today.</p>

<p>But how could they help confiding their
homely cares and difficulties to one so sympathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and so wise? And how could they
help coming to his home as one honored enters
a city the freedom of which has been bestowed
upon him?</p>

<p>It was in the garden room that the home life
of the poet centered; and here his friends
from a distance and the neighbors who were
also friends sought him. In his chair by the
window, or in winter beside the open fire, he
was wont to entertain his guests; and only
those who were thus entertained know how
rich was the feast of thought and soul spread
for even the least worthy of them.</p>

<p>His humor so seldom caught in his writings
by reason of the many and deeper powers in
him, here glowed in his thoughts and flashed
up in his words warming and cheering his
atmosphere as the open fire of which he was so
fond warmed and brightened the garden room.
And, indeed, it seems as if there must have
been a subtle sympathy between the two forces.
For the poet was never keener or more racy
than when, having thrown on fresh wood, he
knelt on one knee, adjusted the sticks, watched
the flames dart out and catch the new fuel,
and then suddenly turned his head with that
birdlike motion of his and made some remark
to his visitor, often, as has been said, catching
the latter’s very thought.</p>

<p>As a poet should sing of his home, Whittier
sang the beauties of the scenery in and around
the town in which he lived, its walks and drives
giving views of hilltop and lake, of stream
and ocean.</p>

<p>Amesbury is set among the hills, Powow Hill
at its back and the swift stream of the same
name running from the foot of this hill through
the town and going on to join the Merrimac.
Amesbury is a border town—the only town
of this name in the whole country, this and its
neighbor Salisbury being called from the famous
Amesbury and its adjacent Salisbury in England.
Amesbury with the beautiful Merrimac
River on its south, has on its north the rounded
summits which make New Hampshire from its
very beginning the land of hills. It was one
of the earliest settled towns in America, receiving
its name in 1667, and electing its board of
“Prudenshall” the following year. From earliest
times, Whittier’s own family figured largely
in the annals of this region, Whittier Hill in
Amesbury having been named from one of
his ancestors. It was impossible that Whittier
should not have deep interest in its history
and legends, and in its people among whom
he had intimate and dear friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p class="p0">With the poet’s keen eye for beauty he saw</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“the winding Powow fold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The green hill in its belt of gold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He pictures on the banks of the Powow old
“Cobbler Keezar” beholding through his magic
lapstone the river, then</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Woodsy and wild and lonesome,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">changed to the day when the mighty forest
was “broken by many a steepled town.”</p>

<p>A stone’s throw from Whittier’s grave still
stands the house of “Goodman Macey,” the
hero of the poem, “The Exiles,” which tells
his story. The haunted house in the poem,
“The New Wife and the Old,” is still pointed
out in Hampton, although recently it has been
removed to another site, restored and inhabited
by other than ghosts. “Margaret Smith’s Journal,”
in his prose writings, takes the reader
through the woods of Newbury giving many
a picturesque incident of the life of the times—and
many a touching one. “The Double-Headed
Snake” is a legend of Newbury; “The
Bridal of Pennacook” sketches the upper
portions of the Merrimac; “The Swan Song
of Parson Avery” sends its singer from the
Newbury shores out beyond the bar and into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the great ocean. In his songs the poet carries
us along the Salisbury shore of the river to the
Chain Bridge which crosses it at Deer Island,
the home of Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford,
his contemporary, herself novelist and poet;
thence up the Newbury shore to that poem of
streamlets, the Artichoke, which slipping beneath
the overhanging boughs of trees that all
but meet across it, goes through the old mill
race—Curson’s Mill—to join the Merrimac.</p>

<p>Beyond the woods and the two rivers lies the
ocean. “The Tent on the Beach” describes
the long stretch of Salisbury before its invasion,
first by shanties and then by hotels and casinos
and cottages, transformed its picturesque solitudes.
But nothing can make less magnificent
the long roll of the incoming surf along its six
miles of almost unbroken reach of sands.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In one of his letters Whittier says:</p>

<p>“The country about here never looked so
beautiful as now. We went to Salisbury pine
woods yesterday after meeting. I never saw
such perfect and glorious effects of light and
shadow—such perfection of green earth and
blue sky—such grottoes and labyrinths of
verdure, barred at the entrance by solid beams
of sunlight, like golden gates. At such times I
wish I were a painter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>In this same letter the poet gives a touch of
home life. “We had a pleasant visit from
Lucy Larcom last week,” he writes. “Brother
Frank was here on sixth day on his way from
Boston—will be back tomorrow or next day.
We have had the famous Moncure Conway
here. He came over last week with the Cursons.”</p>

<p>“The Cursons” were two interesting sisters
of fine New England ancestry. The sisters with
their mother lived at Curson’s Mills where the
fairy Artichoke flows to meet the Merrimac. It
was to these sisters Whittier’s “Lines after a
Summer’s Day’s Excursion” were written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thanks for your graceful oars, which broke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The morning dreams of Artichoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Along his wooded shore!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Varied as varying Nature’s ways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sprites of the river, woodland fays,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or mountain nymphs, ye seem.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In “Snow Bound” Whittier speaks to his
brother as being the only one of that family
group left beside himself. The tie between the
brothers was very close. Many times the poet’s
letters refer to this brother, enjoying him in
health, watching over him when ill, and following
him with fadeless love when Franklin passed
on before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>A relative of the Whittiers and at one time in
the poet’s family has spoken to the writer of the
brightness and wit of Franklin, himself also a
writer although under an assumed name, and
of the brilliant conversation of the two men as
they sat together in the garden room, their
reminiscences and familiar talk interrupted by
peals of laughter. For the poet who showed
chiefly his grave side to the world had in him a
rich vein of humor—and his friends and neighbors
knew that it never gave out through want
of being worked! Franklin’s daughter, her
aunt’s namesake, lived with the poet from early
girlhood until her marriage.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>How Whittier loved all that region! But
most of all, he sings of the Merrimac—river
worthy of his songs!—of the Merrimac bordering
the town of his birth and of his later
home, the river of which he says “never was it
by its valley-born forgotten.” With what
delight he pictures its loveliness from its source
among “Winnepesaukee’s hundred isles, through
the green repose of Plymouth meadows, the
gleam and ripple of Campton rills,” to where it
flows, “green-tufted, oak-shaded by Amoskeag’s
fall,” and adown its gleaming miles to “Salisbury’s
beach of shining sand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Whittier’s Indian poems, except “Mogg Megone”
and “Pentucket,” breathe that note of
sadness for the defeated and sorrowing which
he always felt and which his spirit will feel until
such defeat and sorrow are wiped out of the
world—the very spirit of his writings and of
his life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Still thy love, O Christ arisen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yearns to reach these souls in prison.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To his faith the message of the Spirit is sent
everywhere and its</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“... tongues of fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On dusty tribes and twilight centuries sit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Spofford in a delightful sketch of the
poet tells how in the stirring events of the early
days of the seventeenth century, in the midst
of the bitter strife between the red man and the
white, the Whittiers lived in the calm and safety
of their own peaceful Quaker faith. They
were as was William Penn to the red man.
Indian attacks, Indian massacres, white women
and children fleeing to the fort for their lives,
white men with the rifles mowing down red
savages—as the red savages whenever they
could find or make opportunity tomahawked
and scalped in hate the white intruders—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Whittier household had no part in these horrors;
these were crimes they neither perpetrated nor
suffered from. Their door was always on the
latch; no gun was ever behind it, or in the hands
of its men. The Indians entered and departed
at will, always to meet with kindness and never
to return this by injury, quick to distinguish
between friend and foe, and ready to return
kindness with confidence. For that household
there were no wild terrors, no midnight
massacres.</p>

<p>This fact, while it gives to the character the
courage and faith in God and man shown by
the Whittier ancestry as Friends, also, it should
be remembered, speaks significantly for the
appreciation of these traits by the “noble red
man.” Many times the Indian has shown that
he was capable of response to confidence in him
and the appeal to his sense of honor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At one time the poet was applied to for a fitting
name for a house recently built in the region
of Kenoza Lake on the outskirts of Haverhill.
He answered the friends who forwarded the
request:</p>

<p>“I have looked over Roger Williams’ ‘Key to
the Indian Language,’ and find nothing that
seems quite to answer Mr. S——’s purpose.</p>

<p>‘Yokomish—I lodge here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Nowekin—I dwell here.</p>

<p>Wotomuck—At Home.</p>

<p>Washowanan—Hawk or Hawk’s Place.</p>

<p>Wussokat—Walnut Trees.’</p>

<p>Most of the names are very long and hard to
pronounce. How would the name of the great
Sachem, or Chief, on the Merrimac River and
whose father owned the whole valley, do for the
place? It is a pleasant, well-sounding name and
wouldn’t be inappropriate; for the Sachem who
bore it doubtless had wandered through the
woods and fished in the lakes between which the
house stands—Wolanset. He was the son of
Passaconaway, the mightiest Indian chief in the
Northern section of New England and who
always made his home on the banks of the Merrimac.
Both were friends of the whites and all
the associations of their names are pleasant.”</p>

<p>To Whittier, a Friend, a man of peace, the
Civil War with its sufferings, its horrors, its
changing fortunes, and for those days its vast
sacrifice of life was a continual torture. Yet
he realized its significance. From the firing
of the first gun at Sumter he perceived that
the war was destined to sweep from the land
the crime of slavery. His inspired poem,
“Laus Deo,” declares what that meant to
him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Being a Quaker, the poet was, of course,
never present at war meetings.</p>

<p>But when during the war contributions were
sent from Amesbury, as from other towns,
to the front, Whittier was always greatly
interested. He knew when boxes went to the
soldiers, and he was often well posted as to
the contents of these boxes.</p>

<p>And upon one occasion, at least, he was
memorably on hand—to some regretfully
so—when the townspeople were raising subscriptions
for the Sanitary Commission and for
the soldiers. Patriotism was at a low ebb
that day, for the subscriptions lagged persistently,
so that when it came time for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
meeting to break up, the needed amount had
not been raised, and things looked as if it would
not be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Then the authority which the poet as a man
of affairs never failed to put forth at need came
to the front.</p>

<p>Whittier rose.</p>

<p>He wasted no strength in appeal to a patriotism
overswept by avarice; but made his demands
upon that avarice itself.</p>

<p>“If this sum needed,” he said, naming it,
“is not raised by this meeting, I shall write
to Salmon Chase [Secretary of the Treasury]
to have your exemption money on the next
draft of men put up to seven hundred dollars
instead of three hundred, as it is now.”</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>But it was enough. His audience looked
at the speaker’s tall, erect figure, his flashing
eyes, his resolute mouth—and decided not
to take the risk. The required amount was
immediately forthcoming.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>All the world knows how in the poet’s early
days he put aside the ambitions of youth and
genius—ambitions which the early call of
the world to him proved would have been
richly fulfilled—and fought the hard battle
for the slave, and endured its contumely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>His own words tell the story. In his poem,
“Lines Written in the Book of a Friend,”
he sings of himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Founts gushed beside my pilgrim way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cool shadows on the greensward lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flowers swung upon the bending spray.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In vain!—nor dream, nor rest, nor pause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remain for him who round him draws</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The battered mail of Freedom’s cause.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With soul and strength, with heart and hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I turned to Freedom’s struggling band,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the sad Helots of our land.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here was that self-denial, that experience of
longings unfulfilled—through the fulfillment
of higher longings—which gave him his depth
and power of sympathy in every loss and suffering
of others, and courage in the sufferings of
his own life, and which ripened and sweetened
his nature.</p>

<p>Whittier’s prominence in the anti-slavery
conflict is, of course, matter of history. His
influence in politics was great; for he had the
keenness of insight, the broad vision of the
statesman, and the politician’s skill in manipulation
which never deteriorated into political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
trickery in a heart that loved his fellowmen and
a soul that abhorred self-seeking. One day in
a package of books that went from his home
to the doctor’s house, there was slipped in by
accident a bit of paper on which were the two
following lines in the poet’s handwriting, but
unsigned:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That lowest form of worship known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which incense burns to self alone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The identical lines are not found in any of
his poems and were probably altered. But
their spirit is ever with him. Mrs. Claflin in
her interesting sketch of the poet says:</p>

<p>“Mr. Whittier was a keen observer of all
public affairs and the trusted adviser of many
of the most eminent men of the Old Bay State.
He seemed to have prophetic vision and was
one of the most sagacious counselors in the
State then famous for its able men.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2>
</div>


<p>In the January of 1864 Whittier wrote to
M—— C——, a dear Amesbury friend, who
was spending a few weeks at Norfolk under the
protection of the Union army and doing some
work for the soldiers there.</p>

<p>“Thy letter from Norfolk,” he says, “has just
reached us, and we [his sister Elizabeth and
himself] enjoyed its graphic description of
your present locality and prospects.... The
weather here is cold again.... Elizabeth
is much as usual, unable to write
much, so I hold the pen for her. We had a
pleasant visit from Bayard Taylor last week.
Night before last he sent us a picture he painted
in 1857 on the shore of the Arctic Ocean. It is
a view of the little church of Vadso, the
northernmost Russian settlement.... Who
knows but that thee may enter Richmond with
the victorious army! Stranger things have
happened.”</p>

<p>A penciled line from Elizabeth on the same
sheet says:</p>

<p>“M—— dear, a thousand thanks for thy pictures
of ‘Virginia life’—I look from thy window
on the sunken masts of the poor brave Cumberland.
I am so glad you are there. We all are.
Tell Colonel F—— [a young Prussian who at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
beginning of the war had enlisted] the doctor
and his wife quite forgive his not coming to
Amesbury; the doctor hopes—the fatigue of
going well over—the Colonel will grow stronger;
he seems to feel he had worked too hard....
It was delightful to see our dear old friend
Bayard. He will bring his beautiful German
wife here before long.... How I wish I
could unroof that Norfolk house and see you all;
the graceful young adjutant pleases me. Tell
Col. F—— I never wondered he could not find
time to write. I only wonder he is alive....
It is so good to hear from thee. Keep well—and
come home soon.”</p>

<p>To the Col. F—— (afterward General) then
at the front the poet wrote:</p>

<p>“We watch with ever wakeful interest the
progress of the war. Sometimes we feel discouraged;
but the good God sees and knows all
and His time is best.... My sister [Elizabeth],
Miss B—— [who, later Col. F—— married],
and Dr. S—— and family desire to be
kindly remembered to thee.”</p>

<p>The mention of Bayard Taylor in these letters
recalls Whittier’s poem, “Bayard Taylor,” in
which the poet refers to this visit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘And where now, Bayard, will thy footsteps tend?’</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">My sister asked our guest one winter’s day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smiling, he answered in the Friends’ sweet way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Common to both: ‘Wherever thou shalt send.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘What wouldst thou have me see for thee?’ She laughed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her dark eyes dancing in the wood-fire’s glow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Loffoden isles, the Kilpis, and the low</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unsetting sun on Finmark’s fishing craft.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With abounding faith in the ultimate triumph
of right, the poet yet had all the dread of
disaster incident to so sensitive an organization.
At the defeat at Bull Run he was prostrated.</p>

<p>It is in the major and the minor of his sufferings
and his trust that his songs, “In War Time,”
were sung. “Luther’s Hymn,” the sombreness
of “The Watchers,” the depth of prayer in “Thy
Will Be Done”—all show the struggle and
sorrow of his spirit. But hope speaks in “The
Battle Autumn of 1862,” where he sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, give to us in times like these,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The vision of her eyes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And make her fields and fruited trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Our golden prophecies!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, give to us her finer ear!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Above this stormy din,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We, too, would hear the bells of cheer</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ring peace and freedom in.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p>His “Port Royal” is a burst of joy and
triumph, with the song of the freedmen in the
minor key, so far are they yet from the reality
of the freedom which they have in name. In
“Barbara Frietchie” we have not only an
inspiring ballad which has flown the wide world
over; but we have also a touch of the nobler
nature of the South epitomized in the order
of Stonewall Jackson; and the poem, in trend
if not in speech, is a prophecy of returning
loyalty, a prophecy of the day when—not
by force, but through love of them—the
stars and stripes were to float over North and
South alike.</p>

<p>One day during the Civil War, when the poet
was at her house, the doctor’s wife said to him:</p>

<p>“Mr. Whittier, what did you mean when you
wrote that poem, ‘What of the Day’? You
wrote it in 1857, four years before the war.
It’s a perfect prophecy of the present time.

<p>What did you mean by it?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“I don’t know myself what I meant by it,”
he answered her as earnestly as she had spoken;

inspiration, a real prophecy.</p>

of the life of today we turn for glimpses of his
inspiration.</p>

<p>Whittier was born into love of right and freedom
and the atmosphere of his home fostered
this.</p>

<p>Even in speaking the words, “My mother,”
his very tone changed to loving reverence.
No doubt he owed much to her in the help
and inspiration which great men so often owe
to their mothers. Yet it was for what she
embodied in herself, even more than what she
was to him, that he reverenced her. She was
a strong, high-souled woman, thoughtful and
full of the ability and resources which the training
of the Friends develops so remarkably
in their woman. None of the broad questions
which interested her son were too great for her.
On the contrary, the life of devotion to the
freedom of the slave which Whittier and his
sister Elizabeth lived, had been born with
them and preached into their ears and laid
upon their hearts from their childhood. It
was not Mrs. Whittier who followed their lead
for companionship with them; it was they who
took up the service to which she desired and
prayed to have them consecrated.</p>

<p>“I shall not live to see the slaves made free,”
said the poet’s mother one day to a friend.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Then she added confidently, “But my children
will.”</p>

<p>Was this prophecy the result of her faith
in the inevitable triumph of righteousness and
a guess so shrewd as to seem intuition concerning
the causes at work to bring about this
consummation speedily? Or did this devout
Quaker speak the promptings of the Spirit
when she uttered a prediction which at the time
seemed so little likely to be fulfilled?</p>

<p>Yet it was fulfilled. Mrs. Whittier died
in 1857. Her oldest daughter also died before
the prophecy came to pass. But her two sons
lived to rejoice in it; and Elizabeth, described
in “Snow Bound” as “our youngest and our
dearest,” her brother’s close comrade in intellectual
and loving fellowship, died in the September
of 1864, so that she lived beyond the day
of the Emancipation Proclamation and saw its
fulfillment in the triumph of the Union armies.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the death of her mother, Elizabeth wrote
of her to M—— C——, an intimate Amesbury
friend absent at the time:</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Our dear mother was so unselfish and good,
so pitiful and forbearing, so ready and hopeful....
I was not half thankful enough for such
a mother. She was growing more and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
beautiful in her life each day. Very dear and
lovely is her memory. We cannot doubt she
has found the peace and rest that hath an everlasting
continuance. I long for faith. I do
indeed believe and try to look up for help in
my unbelief. But for such a life and close as
hers how dare I ever hope? I desire to trust
in the sweet, childlike way I remember in her.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At the time of Mrs. Whittier’s death, she with
the poet and his sister Elizabeth was in the
Amesbury home which had been bought after
the sale of the farm and homestead in Haverhill,
the birthplace of all her children. This Amesbury
home was a small dwelling on Friend Street,
named from the fact that it led past the Friends’
meeting-house not far from this new home.
Whittier’s biographer tells how the poet planned
the new meeting-house which stands further
up the street and faces a small common, with a
by-road winding down on its other side behind
the village, as it then was, and leading on to
the old burying-ground where the poet now lies.</p>

<p>In such simplicity of life and holiness of purpose
must be invigorating power. No home
of luxury and self-indulgence could have
produced a Whittier.</p>

</div>


<p>Whittier’s biography mentions the encouragement
given to his earliest attempts at literature
and the prospect thus held out to him of
fame and competence in comparative youth;
of his congenial work in Boston and his opportunities
there for study and research.</p>

<p>But in the garden room by his own fireside
the poet one day told the writer of an early
experience given later in his biography. To his
astonishment he had been called upon by George
D. Prentice, then editor of the “New England
Review,” to take charge of this magazine during
Prentice’s temporary absence. Whittier’s secret
tremors had not caused him an instant’s hesitation
in accepting the position; and as the
phrase goes, he soon “caught on.”</p>

<p>But before long there came a malignant attack
upon one of his editorials, an anti-slavery article
called forth by some incident of the day; and no
doubt Whittier had struck out from the shoulder,
as was his habit in fighting against wrong. The
poet in his youth and inexperience was overwhelmed
by the virulence of the attack and wondered
at first if he should not take the writer’s
scornful advice and “go back to the farm.” But
he did no such thing; he braced himself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
“made good.” Telling the story that day in the
garden room with the world singing his praises, he
added that he did not know what had become of
that critic. But this remark was far from wishing
to emphasize his own eminent position; there
was not an iota of boast in Whittier; it was
made as a significant encouragement to his
youthful companion who, as he knew, had felt
the sting of literary rebuffs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was not in literature alone, however, that
the spirit moved him to say and do the kind
thing. A short time after the Civil War his
friend, Dr. S——, who had been long trying to
secure a pension for a soldier’s widow, very
poor, at last appealed to the poet to help him.
Whittier sent the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Amesbury, 26, 10th mo., 1867 (or 69)<br>
<br>
“Dear General:<br>
</p>

<p>Our excellent friend General F—— goes to
Boston today with reference to the pension of
Mrs. D—— of this town whose husband lost his
life in the service of his country. It is a very
urgent case and there has been some difficulty
in obtaining the needed papers; but I hope if it
is in thy power, thee will aid him in his object.</p>

<p class="right">
Very truly thy friend,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">John G. Whittier.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>The pension was secured.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The world knows well many of the poet’s rare
and gracious qualities. But the life that Whittier
lived in his own family and among his neighbors,
the traits that came out in this daily
life—these are not known to the world, and
never can be, except by lightest sketches. Yet
of all his poems the most beautiful was his life.</p>

<p>It was in 1869 that he wrote the following
characteristic note to Dr. S——, the “doctor”
of these pages:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Dear Doctor:<br>
</p>

<p>There is to be what they call a surprise party
at Mrs. C——’s this evening—the anniversary
of her marriage forty years ago. They would
like to see thee and Mrs. S——, I am sure. It
was got up by some of her friends and relatives.”</p>
</div>

<p>The poet does not mention that he himself
was one of the “friends” most active in this
endeavor to help a neighbor to tide over one of
those hard places plentifully scattered throughout
her life. Her home was across the little side
street from Mr. Whittier’s. She had always
been a friend and many times a nurse to his
sister Elizabeth. For in those days when
trained nurses were rare in the country, she often
went into families to nurse in illness. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
been much in the poet’s home in his anxiety,
his sorrow, and his own times of straitened
means.</p>

<p>Her early opportunities of education had been
small, and yet the terms on which she lived with
the Whittier family were in themselves an
education. Whittier appreciated her love of
books, and it is to her advice that the world owes
a beautiful poem. One day when she was in
the house he came out of the garden room with
a volume of “Mrs. Jamieson” in his hand, and
reading this neighbor in whose literary judgment
he believed, that writer’s account of the origin
of the stars and stripes, he remarked that it
would be a good subject for a poem.</p>

<p>“Indeed, it would; and you are just the one
to write it,” retorted his listener with spirit.
“Why don’t you do it?”</p>

<p>The poet returned to his room. And we have
“The Mantle of St. John de Matha.”</p>

<p>Years afterward when poverty and illness
had become intimates of hers, from her bed of
pain which was henceforth to know only respite
and not cure, she epitomized in a sentence the
poet’s character. Looking up into the face of
the writer who standing beside her had been
speaking of him, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh—Mr. Whittier!” Her voice choked,
her face lighted, her eyes filled with tears. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
saw the past with its many trials and sufferings,
and to relieve these whenever possible, that
blessed presence whose visits to her in her need
had not been in one respect as is wrongly said
of the angels—“few and far between.” In a
moment she added brokenly, “When you need
<i>him</i>, you never have to say, ‘Come!’ he’s
always there!”</p>

<p>He was “always there” for any need of any
one that he could meet, and he could meet many
and diverse needs. For his was his Master’s
definition of his neighbor. There was nothing
in the range of human experience to which he
did not accord open-hearted sympathy—except
meanness of motive and falsity of any kind.
Yet mixed with hatred of the sin was always
compassion for the sinner; for no empty words
to him were these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And hope for all the language is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That He remembereth we are dust.”</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2>
</div>


<p>It was not Whittier’s habit to say in word or
manner,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Vex not the poet’s mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thy shallow wit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the contrary, if the wit were shallow this
poet was likely to gather amusement from its
exhibition, and so reimburse himself for any
small outlay of patience. Nor was this all, nor
even half. For if the best in persons was small,
it was his joy to bring out this best. So he
found interest in persons in whom others could
see none and sometimes developed in them
unexpected possibilities. For more than anything
except faith in God, he had faith in men;
speaking reverently, he read them Godward—as
they were meant to be.</p>

<p>Yet his often silent laugh at men’s foibles was
hearty; and nothing so amused him as the
bewildered expression of one lost in the mazes
of a joke. And not seldom he tried his hand
at bringing such an expression; for he had an
immense enjoyment of credulity.</p>

<p>Two friends of the poet had been invited to
his house to tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>In the garden room with the flashings of the
open fire pointing and illustrating his words,
Whittier sat entertaining his guests with a fish
story—a whale story in which the originator
had striven to outdo Jonah. The poet’s countenance
was as grave as a judge’s; his eyes were
now dropped as if recalling the points of the
story—which lost nothing in their narration—and
now fastened upon the faces of his listeners.
He found one hearer’s eyes dilated and her lips
parted in absolute absorption and faith. With
unshaken gravity the poet continued, until the
voice of his other listener broke in upon the tale
with the suggestion that this was really a most
remarkable yarn. Like a flash he turned upon
her in mock anger. “Thee doubts that, Lucy?”
he cried. “Why, a Quaker told me that story.”
But the spell being broken, he laughed as heartily
as the others.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A former resident of Amesbury brought up
most strictly, and rigid in adherence to her
tenets, was taken out of these grooves and
put into an entirely different life in New York
City, a life much more liberal in creed and
practice. The unwonted freedom delighted
her and she came home to visit, full of enthusiasm
for her new surroundings. She was
welcomed by the poet who liked her well. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
secret note of the new vivacity in look and
manner, he asked her with much interest,
“And how does thee like New York?”</p>

<p>At the question her enthusiasm burst forth,
and she declared with unction that she liked
it very, very much.</p>

<p>A sparkle of mischief kindled in the poet’s
eye. “Thee likes it because it is so wicked,”
he commented demurely.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But although the poet could laugh at others,
never did he put himself in a position to be
laughed at. So great was his sensitiveness,
that his friends have often heard him say how
keenly he felt mistakes of his which he alone
had perceived—or perhaps imagined; for
he was so resourceful and quick at retort that
nobody could succeed in cornering him in an
argument or a situation.</p>

<p>When in the days of his later fame he had
that well-known meeting with the Emperor
of Brazil, where Dom Pedro in the fashion
of his country had embraced the poet, the
company present after the Emperor’s departure
began to rally the poet upon this form of greeting.
But Whittier turned to his hostess with
that gleam of fun in his eyes which his friends
knew so well, and retorted, “That was meant
for thee!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Unlike many persons, themselves apt, he
enjoyed other people’s wit. It was worth a
thousand miles’ journey to hear him say,
“Capital! Capital!” accompanying the words
and his laugh with that light blow of his hand
upon his knee which was an exclamation point
in pantomime. Such a gesture must have
come into play when he learned Harriet Livermore’s
reception of his description of herself
in the “not unfeared, half welcome guest” of
“Snow Bound.” She is said to have retorted,
“He always was a saucy boy!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There never came to him an episode more
rich in the humor in which his soul delighted
than came through an invitation which he once
received.</p>

<p>Sitting on the sofa in the garden room where
so many in distinguished walks of life had paid
honor to the poet, a young man from a neighboring
town, a self-made man—so far as his
creation had progressed, and, as the saying is,
proud of his maker—discoursed with insistence
concerning a Republican Convention
to be held in the West, and urged the poet
to accompany him there. In vain Whittier
opposed his want of strength to meet such a
strain, and gave other reasons also. As if
the poet had not spoken, the other reiterated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
his arguments, and wound up with this
climax:</p>

<p>“I know, Mr. Whittier,” urged this self-making
young person to the man who as one
of the founders of the Republican party was
held by its leaders in especial honor, “that you
are a very shy man and shrink from meeting
strangers. But I shall be there to introduce you.”</p>

<p>As the poet told of this episode, his eyes
shone with fun and his tone had an unction
which he would not allow his words to express.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whittier’s delight in fun was to him the sunshine
of his many dreary winter days. It is
told of him that, in his thirties, he one day
walked into the old Rocky Hill school house
at Salisbury Point while the school was in
session, and to the astonishment of the children
and the amusement of the teacher who afterward
explained to them that this was John
Greenleaf Whittier, he sat himself down on
the little low seat in front—the dunce’s seat,
or the rogue’s seat as it was then called—a
bench which in his boyhood he could never
have occupied.</p>

<p>Who knows that the poem, “In School Days,”
which he wrote so long afterward did not come
into his heart at that time?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2>
</div>


<p>When after Whittier’s morning writing at
the desk by the French window in the garden
room, the desk on which were written “Snow-Bound,”
“The Tent on the Beach,” and other
well-loved poems, the poet rested, did he go to
the woods, to the fields, to the streams he loved
so well? Undoubtedly, he did sometimes.
But his walks afield were more frequently afternoon
strolls. He lived before the days of the
postman. His morning mail was waiting for
him at the office, and although sometimes he
sent for it, he more frequently went himself, and
rested from his poems by neighborly chats.
On poetry? Hardly—in the post office, or
the grocery store!</p>

<p>He liked the local news of the day; he liked
social intercourse—especially when he could
jump up from his chair, or his sugar barrel,
or wherever he might have been seated and
take his departure when he felt so disposed.</p>

<p>But there was more than this. He also had
a purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Three years previous to the moving of Whittier’s
family to Amesbury had been held the
Anti-Slavery Convention in Philadelphia, in
which Garrison, Whittier, Wright, Samuel J. May,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and so many others whose names are familiar
in the cause of freedom for the slave, had
taken part.</p>

<p>But Whittier’s hopes of more active co-operation
had been ended by his delicate health,
his want of power to endure the fatigues of
such a life as that to which scenes like the
Boston mob, the Philadelphia mob, and convention
work would have subjected him. Yet
he still had work in abundance as Secretary
of the Anti-Slavery Society, as an earnest and
most important advocate of that political
party which some of the anti-slavery reformers
had determined to build up, the principle of
which was inserted in the Albany Anti-Slavery
Convention of 1839.</p>

<p>Whittier was one of the business committee
of this National Convention of Abolitionists
in which the formation of a political anti-slavery
party was inaugurated. The opinion of the
abolitionist, Abraham L. Pennock of Pennsylvania,
made in the January of 1840, six
months after the Convention, Whittier publicly
endorsed the following year as his own opinion
also.</p>

<p>“What an absurdity is moral action apart
from political,” declared both these men who
with others determined to use the legitimate
weapon of their vote in the cause of freedom—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
as a right only, but a duty, since it was in
their hands.</p>

<p>Together with Sumner, Henry Wilson, and
many others at the East, Whittier was working
toward the growth of a political party, eventually
to become one with the great party at
the West where Abraham Lincoln’s “Lincoln-Stone
protest” against the encroachment of
the Slave Power had developed into his famous
debates with Douglas upon slavery, under the
guise of the Kansas-Nebraska bill and other
measures. There had arisen in the country
many forces which in different ways and places,
but with the same object, had come to stand
for opposition to the spread of slavery, and
were assimilating. Forces moral, spiritual, political
were uniting—unconsciously at first—for
the great conflict under the leadership of
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To Whittier’s insight political measures were
to be the salvation of the country he loved
and eventual destruction to the slavery he hated.
To him therefore each man’s vote counted.</p>

<p>While he was in the grocery store, or the
post-office, or in some shop, that especial place
became by power of the poet’s character and
purpose the rendezvous of a political force
that had for its object the turning of politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
from chicanery and bribery into the might
that dwells in an honest man’s vote wisely
given.</p>

<p>If the poet accepted men as he found them,
it was because in them he found good. He
never accepted evil in men or passed it by
with indifference, but strove in some way to
speak the word, or do the act which should
turn the man to good. Politics led by Whittier
in Amesbury was under that same leadership
which by personal counsel as well as by
published poem and word was so helpful in
organizing the Republican party. None recognized
more quickly than did Whittier that
men all over the country were like men in
Amesbury, no more intelligent, no more honest,
no more progressive. And his poems to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rouse the sleeping citizen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Summon out the might of men!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">his written pleas for the right and appeals
against oppression were made to just such men
as those he daily met and talked with.</p>

<p>None knew better than he did that suggestions
and inspirations are in the air and hit
one in the way of them. Whittier had a quality
also accredited to Roosevelt—he went where
things were. How he always managed to get
there in his life of a recluse it is difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
explain, except upon the principle that electricity
travels a thousand miles as readily as
one, and the poet’s perceptions were charged
with spiritual electricity.</p>

<p>Therefore these men whom he was daily
meeting had something to say to him also,
although often unconsciously; and his knowledge
of their powers and possibilities, of how
they looked at things, and how to reach their
hearts gave to his “Songs of Freedom” a note
of power that sent them ringing over the land.</p>

<p>As leader and inspirer he stood—not autocrat.
He cared to know all men’s opinions,
and his weapons were argument and persuasion,
and that keen rapier of retort which pierced
many a false theory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Yet, as it has been said, in these morning
hours politics were not all. The poet had been
writing; he needed recreation. Everything
that was going on around him was of interest
to him; the local story, the fun, the jest, the
laugh were not wanting; nor was any situation
with the possibility of humor in it lost upon
this politician and poet. He appreciated broadcloth,
he delighted in cultured phrase; both
he could find in his own town. But where
these were lacking,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A man’s a man for a’ that.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>
<p>For Whittier lived so much in the realities
that he held men as they stood in the ranks of
character, and in reading them he was wonderfully
keen.</p>

<p>So, he talked and listened and joked and
laughed with his fellow-townsmen, and reckoned
among them many a true friend.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In a letter to Mrs. F—— written in the
November of 1876, he says:</p>

<p>“What does the Colonel think of the election?
I staid to vote in Amesbury and have been
here for ten days or more. The dismal and
misty weather seems to correspond with the
doubtful and wearisome political condition
of the country. For myself, I would prefer
to see Tilden president than to elect Hayes by
fraud. Yet there seems a possibility of his
fair election.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After giving some Amesbury news to a correspondent,
he adds:</p>

<p>“Do thee ever think of our sojourn at the
Bearcamp House? I always recall it with
pleasure. H—— C—— [a young friend of
whom Whittier was fond] is now in Amesbury.
He is still, I hope, improving.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="X">X</h2>
</div>


<p>Sometimes the poet did not see his friends
and acquaintances upon the street, or he was
too absorbed in a poem—or, alas it may have
been with a headache—to give sign of recognition.
Yet to a neighbor who one day laughingly
accused him of “cutting” her, he spoke
of the two persons whom he never failed to
recognize, whatever his preoccupation—one
an old cooper, the other an old lame man, both
of whom through their poverty found many
persons blind to them.</p>

<p>But, again, sometimes Whittier’s eyes served
him well. One morning coming out of the post-office,
he saw the doctor driving past and the
two stopped to greet one another. Then, as
the interview seemed finished and the doctor
was about to drive on again, the poet said in
an undertone:</p>

<p>“Don’t thee go yet. There’s So-and-So,”
naming a bore, “waiting for me. Let him get
by first.”</p>

<p>So the poet and the doctor’s carriage stood
in the road until Mr. “So-and-So” grew tired
of waiting and took himself off.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Occasionally, a visitor who happened to be
in the garden room when the poet returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
from the post-office was treated to tidbits from
his mail. One day he read aloud a letter from
a woman of brilliant literary fame and brilliant
personality. She announced that she was coming
to visit him.</p>

<p>“She is one of the most easily entertained
visitors I ever have,” he commented, “for I
don’t have to answer her; I don’t get a chance!”
And as he laughed, he knew well that, had the
writer of the letter heard him, she would have
had her retort ready. For when did Gail
Hamilton ever fail of a good retort? “Now,
what does she send that to an old fellow like
me for?” he went on, holding out a snip of her
new gown which for his edification she had
inclosed in her letter.</p>

<p>She told him also where she was about to
visit and added her request for a letter from
him, or for a few words, or for merely his name,
so that in a moment of abstraction she could
draw the envelope from her pocket as by accident,
and drop it back again with the remark,
“Ah, a letter from Whittier!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The poet in speaking to a friend about his
comprehension of character, told how he sometimes
regretted this ability. She responded
that at times she also read people better than
she liked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“So do I, Mrs. S——,” he answered eagerly.
“I read them too well.” His sensitive organization
which vibrated to the least change in
the winds of heaven, vibrated also to human
emotions and passions in others.</p>

<p>And yet here his kindness did not fail him;
nor when face to face with evil, did he rebuke
the evil-doer with any consciousness of superior
personal merit. Instead, he appealed from the
evil in evidence to the good in reserve.</p>

<p>As when one morning in the garden room
he listened to an amazing proposition, namely—that
his visitor should write the poetry, which
the poet was assured by the speaker the latter
could do fluently, and that Whittier should
put his name to it, which would make it sell,
and that the two should share the profits!</p>

<p>The poet showed no anger at the suggestion
of linking his name with doggerel, or contempt
for the other’s stupendous conceit. It was
the deceit which he attacked.</p>

<p>“Thee is a minister of the Gospel,” he answered
the man. “Now, does thee think it
would be right to do a thing like that?”</p>

<p>Whittier was not one of the philanthropists
whose affections are all for the world in general
with home left out in the cold. On the contrary,
his home affections were very strong;
and his thought of his sister Elizabeth in her
invalidism was constant, his care and anxiety
for her unremitting. Whatever suited Elizabeth
best was what he desired; wherever she
would be most benefitted was where he wished
to go. Although he preferred the mountains,
yet for his sister’s sake he would go to the
seaside; as for his sake she would choose the
mountains when the ocean breezes suited her
better.</p>

<p>On entering his home after an absence, his
first question always was, “Well, Elizabeth,
how has thee been since I’ve been away?”</p>

<p>His publication of her poems and what he
says of them prove his estimation of her as
a poet. Her judgment, her sympathy, her
affection, her criticism, her inspiration were
all in all to him.</p>

<p>To the outside world she was a brilliant
talker, a cordial hostess, a devoted friend. To
her brother she was home itself.</p>

<p>Slender and delicate as Miss Whittier had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
always been, she had known in her own person
somewhat of the lawlessness and violence
invoked against the cause she championed.
For she, then a girl of twenty, had been present
as a member of the Women’s Anti-Slavery
Society, in the October of 1835, when the
Boston mob surrounded the building in which
the meeting was held and attacked Garrison
who was to address it.</p>

<p>She was one of the brave women who,
two by two, arm in arm, one woman white,
one black, the former to protect the latter as
far as possible, marched through the mob to
the house of Mrs. Chapman, where the adjourned
meeting was held, and the officers duly elected.</p>

<p>Devoted, brave, indomitable, resolute in
purpose, Elizabeth Whittier’s intense interest
in all that concerned the freedom of the slave,
as well as her great literary ability, made
her her brother’s companion and coadjutor.
For to Whittier himself this cause was dearest;
it was the cause which to his latest day
he was more glad and proud to have championed
than he was of all the fame his writings had
brought him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Even when Whittier’s fame was still identified
with a cause which for the time kept
him from the wider knowledge of the public,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
many guests were attracted by his name and
personality. Not a few of these came from
homes of much greater elaboration than the
poet’s. Elizabeth felt this; yet never in her
inmost heart was she untrue to the cause for
which the poet had chosen poverty—almost
obloquy.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="002" style="max-width: 43.5625em;">
  <img class="w75" src="images/002.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth H. Whittier</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Yet once when guests were coming who lived
in a style far beyond the simplicity of the
Whittier home, she spoke out her dread of
the inward comments which she knew would
be made by the strangers.</p>

<p>But her brother had his consolation ready—who
ever saw him when he was not ready?</p>

<p>“Why, Elizabeth,” the poet made answer,
“it’s all upholstery. What does thee care
for upholstery?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To one with so little physical strength as
Miss Whittier had, the frequent and sudden
influx of guests was often a trial.</p>

<p>Never was it more so than when at noon
one washing day the stage coach drove up to
the house, and, unannounced, two ladies
descended from it, the driver following with
a trunk which he deposited in the hall and
departed. Miss Whittier faced the strangers
with the trepidation of a housekeeper who
conjures up visions of dust where none should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
be and who—still worse—takes counsel with
herself concerning the state of the larder.
Her welcome of her visitors, although kindly,
was not wholly free from embarrassment.</p>

<p>But these were housekeepers also; and
they understood, it may be far more than it
was desired that they should do. For, the
next moment one of them sat down upon her
trunk and burst into tears of mortification
at their having in this way imposed themselves
upon strangers.</p>

<p>With the first tear, however, the distress
of their hostess fled. She no longer cared a
jot for household disarray—which had been
chiefly a matter of her own imagination—and
her welcome of her guests was the beginning
of a life-long friendship with Alice and
Phoebe Cary.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Elizabeth Whittier, this very dainty Quaker
lady, was exquisite in her hues of drab when
occasion demanded; yet with all her feminine
nature she loved the colors most becoming
to her dark complexion and hair and her beautiful
dark eyes. When the summer sun shone
hot, a visitor might find her charmingly,
although most simply gowned in a pink cambric,
or even a buff one which was quite as
much to her taste, her white linen cuffs turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
up over the wristbands and her collar of linen
in the fashion of the day.</p>

<p>Yet it was artistic instinct and not vanity
which made these selections. For Miss Whittier’s
estimate of herself was always most
humble. She never appreciated her own brilliance
of face and conversation and her own
great charm of manner. Herself dark, she
delighted in fairness of skin and could not
picture angels other than blue-eyed and golden-haired.</p>

<p>She was very fond of music, well nigh forbidden
to Quakers in those days; and a young
neighbor with a very sweet voice would often
go to her home and sing to her, to Miss Whittier’s
great delight. So sensitive to sound
was she that voices took shapes to her; they
were round, and square, and of different shapes,
some of them, no doubt, angular enough!</p>

<p>A little girl visiting relatives in Amesbury
went one day with these to the poet’s home.
She had never seen either the poet or his sister,
and Miss Whittier’s prominent nose, indicative
of her literary taste, but to a child exceedingly
pronounced, caught her attention. She stared
at it steadily, until Whittier who had been
watching her covered her with confusion by
saying to her:</p>

<p>“Well, and how does thee like Quaker noses?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>What hospitality, what cordiality in Miss
Whittier’s way of leading along a guest by the
hand given in greeting, until she had placed her
in the most comfortable seat!</p>

<p>Like her brother she had that keenness of
retort often at once brilliant and yet full of
kindly consolation. A young friend came to her
one day overwhelmed by the many troubles and
sorrows of her lot and in a mood which found
life altogether too hard to be borne. Miss
Whittier with many a word of sympathy for
her griefs said to her at last:</p>

<p>“But what would thee have? Thee would
not be an oyster, would thee?”</p>

<p>And before the eyes of her listener there rose
in consolation that antithesis of pain, a radiant
vision of the joy of life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A letter from Miss Whittier gives glimpses of
the home life and proves her loyalty to home and
friends. She writes:</p>

<p>“I was away more than four weeks. It is
now nearly four since I came back. No, Mary,
Greenleaf has not been out in his old coat and
hat hunting asters and gentians. I wish he
could. He has been home a few days. He
seemed to have had a pleasant tour all about;
but for more than a fortnight he has been quite
sick, has had a visit from the doctor every day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
He seems <i>somewhat</i> better now, but has hardly
<i>faith</i> enough himself. He says the war is waiting
while he is ill.</p>

<p>“I have missed thee, Mary, sadly; but I know
how delightful it must be in Rehoboth home, so
I am patient. Greenleaf has not wanted to see
anyone; but I am sure he would be rejoiced to
see thee.</p>

<p>“My little journey was <i>very</i> pleasant, in Lynn
among dear old friends and Aunt Phoebe so
glad to have me—and then in Reading, of
course, nothing could be better. I think the
Reading sunshine and moonlight more wonderful
than anything I had known before. I do not
feel <i>quite</i> as much stronger as I did when I first
came home, but am sure it did me good. I was
only one day with dear Hattie Sewall at Melrose....
M—— dear, if I don’t go so
much among the glorious woods, I know how
beautiful these warm, bright days must be to
you, gypsying as you are. I did not go to the
Fair, but ’twas all very nice and Lucy Larcom
sent me a great bunch of fringed gentians the
<i>day after</i>. How do you all feel about the war?
For my part, I will keep faith in Frémont!
What does it all mean—the murmurs against
Frémont?...</p>

<p>“Only think! Theodore Winthrop’s brother
has sent me a photograph of Major Winthrop, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
very pure young spiritual face it is—just such
a one as I seemed to see in the moonlight on the
banks of the Potomac—for thee knows he said,
‘It is full moon always at Camp Camison.’ I
will enclose a notice of thy friend F——’s regiment.
I think poor A—— must miss thee. I
have seen her once. I love A——, the little I
know of her—she is so calm and good....</p>

<p>“The doctor has just taken Greenleaf to ride
a little way. The morning is perfect after the
storm. I wonder where thee are just now—out
in the sunshine, no doubt.... The dear
little kitten went in a basket to L—— M——
who wrote a note of thanks and welcome to
kitty. Greenleaf joins me in love to thee and
thy friends. Aunt Dolly sends her love. We
shall expect thee by and by. When shall thee
look homewards?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In another letter from Boston to the same
friend, Miss Whittier speaks of Fredrika Bremer,
who was at that time in America.</p>

<p>“Miss Bremer doesn’t seem a great light after
all,” she says; “she is far more like a good,
social hearth-fire making one comfortable. I
want you, my dear, good friend, to see her in
Amesbury. Tell Annie, Miss Bremer is especially
drawn to soft, light curls like hers; they
remind her of London. I know she would fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
in love with Annie and her blue eyes. A brother
of Mr. J——, the wonderful, drank tea with us
on seventh day evening. He looked happy, and
we thought he was a good, commonplace body.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whittier in the note to his poem, “To Fredrika
Bremer,” writes: “It is proper to say that these
lines are the joint impromptu of my sister and
myself. They are inserted here as an expression
of our admiration of the gifted stranger whom
we have since learned to love as a friend.”</p>

<p>The poem begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Seeress of the misty Norland,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Daughter of the Vikings bold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Welcome to the sunny Vineland,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which thy fathers sought of old.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To this friend to whom Miss Whittier writes
so lovingly, the poet also says in a letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot but feel that thou hast greatly
over-rated the benefits derived from my society
and friendship. In fact, I feel very much as a
debtor in these hard times might be supposed
to feel if his creditor should take occasion to
thank him for his indebtedness. The obligation
is on my side rather than thine. To me and
mine thou hast been an ever kind and sympathizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
friend—one whom we never met
without pleasure or parted with without regret.
For myself, as for them, <i>my heart thanks thee</i>.
Thou hast cheered us and helped us in many
ways by example as well as words. We have
read, thought, hoped, feared, enjoyed, and
suffered together and the ties of affection and
sympathy so woven from the very tissues of
our lives are not easily severed. We miss
thee greatly in our little circle; we shall often
speak of thee in the dark winter days and long
to see thy familiar face in the light of our evening
fires.</p>

<p>“What beautiful and serene November days
we have had! The weather now grows colder
with keen premonitions of winter. W—— has
gone to Washington. He started on seventh
day morning. I saw the poor fellow off. There
was a prophecy of home-sickness in his face as he
left. We shall miss him. Banks is governor
by twenty-four thousand plurality. The morning
after election Elizabeth crowned his picture
with thy wreath. Mother sends much love.
So does Lizzy [his sister Lizzy]. We shall be
glad to hear from thee.”</p>

</div>


<p>One day in the garden room Whittier spoke
laughingly of some early stories of his that
he had recently found when rummaging in
the garret. He assured his listener—the
writer—that they were not so bad! No
persuasion, however, could induce him to show
them, or even tell her more about them. But
not a few of his poems have a dramatic touch
which suggests that had he not been reformer
and poet, he would have been famous in
romance.</p>

<p>It may have been this faculty of romance
which has given to “My Playmate,” “In
School Days,” and several other of his poems
touches which might well be construed into
a meaning more tender than friendship alone.
Another such is “A Valentine,” written to
this same friend of Elizabeth and of the poet
himself, and never published. On the envelope
was written in the handwriting of the recipient,
“Valentine from J. G. W.—1849.” It reads:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">To meet some spirit that could answer mine;</div>

    <div class="verse indent10">To talk with thine.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, thou wilt cherish what some hearts would spurn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So gentle and so full of soul thou art,</div>

    <div class="verse indent10">Thine own true heart!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His niece, Lizzie Whittier, afterward Mrs.
Pickard, told of the poet’s strong home affections.
She said that from his early childhood
in his games he was always playing at house-keeping;
and all his life the ideal of home and
the love of it never left his heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A rose-cloud, dimly seen above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Melting in heaven’s blue depths away,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, sweet, fond dream of human love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For thee I may not pray,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">he sings in “The Wish of Today.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An Amesbury neighbor, a cousin of “The
Countess” of his poem, told the writer of a
remark of his. “All the ladies with whom
I am associated are in homes different from
mine,” he had said, it may be speaking especially
of the friends of his early days. But she had
added that all his life, wherever he had been
placed he had been socially among the first.</p>

<p>This same neighbor also repeated the poet’s
remark to another friend who, too, was related<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
to the heroine of one of his poems. “In one
thing thee have done better than I have,”
he had said to him—“thee have married a
good wife.”</p>

<p>The finest comment in Carpenter’s book
on Whittier is that upon “Benedicite.” No
other poem so expresses the renunciation of
Whittier’s life and that purity and holiness
of character which made women especially
his dear and loving friends.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Once, unknown to the poet, his sister sent to
the doctor’s home for inspection an exquisite
miniature on ivory of a very beautiful woman.
Miss Whittier’s message with the miniature was
that this was the portrait of a lady whom the
poet had loved, but that she had turned from
him and married another. Now, however, in
her widowhood and his greater fame she had
looked back at him again.</p>

<p>Today’s question is, would she have been won
had she found in him his old ardor and less resignation?
At least she complained to him of the
loss of this ardor. His letters assured her that
his feelings to her were the same, but that her
“fine artistic nature” could not endure the hard,
uncongenial influences of his life surroundings.
How much had his ardent emotion softened into
tender and constant friendship? If his narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
income at that time forbade him; or if loyalty
to his sister would not permit him to put another
over the home of which she had been so long the
light, who can tell?</p>

<p>This miniature was the portrait of Elizabeth
Lloyd to whom the poet’s letters have been
published. Was she the inspirer of “Benedicite,”
that poem of a deep and holy love?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Bayard Taylor was ready to bring to
Amesbury “his beautiful German wife” whom
the poet’s sister had been so eager to see, Miss
Whittier was too ill to make the visit possible.</p>

<p>For months she had been growing weaker
and more suffering. The doctor sent her to
Boston to be in care of Dr. Z——, then a very
famous woman physician. During this time
Miss Whittier visited Mrs. W——, a sister of
Dr. S——.</p>

<p>But in spite of all efforts the disease progressed,
and Elizabeth returned to Amesbury
worse. From that time she steadily failed, and
in the late summer of 1864 she passed to the life
beyond.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The doctor’s wife who was often in Miss
Whittier’s room during the latter part of her
illness could well have given a touch of the
poet’s inner life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>One day Elizabeth in a spasm of pain looked
up at her brother from this friend who was
bending over her.</p>

<p>“Ah, Greenleaf,” she said, “I wish thee had
a good, strong wife like the doctor’s.”</p>

<p>“So do I, Elizabeth,” he answered her. “But
thee knows—”</p>

<p>The finishing of that sentence the hearer
never told beyond the limits of her own home.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After Elizabeth’s death, in his loneliness and
his loyalty to those who had gone, Whittier’s
heart uttered itself. How could the world
help listening to the voice of such a heart as
spoke in “Snow Bound?”</p>

<p>When wider fame and money followed the
writing of this poem, the poet was full of
tender regret that those he loved best were
not here to share. One day he spoke to the
writer of his increased income and how he
wished that he could have given his sisters
what they did not have while they were with
him. And again, when some strong wind of
praise had swept down upon him, he said to
one who had known Elizabeth: “If my sister
could have lived to see this day, how happy
she would have been!”</p>

<p>But he saw “the stars shine through his
cypress trees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>To him life broadened more and more. It
was given him to learn yet more fully the
truth which his labor for the slave had so well
prepared him to comprehend. For to him
in a deeper sense than ever before those who
did God’s will and work in the world were
united with him, as with his Master, in a
spiritual bond.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After the death of Elizabeth the poet’s dearest
friends hoped that he would marry. He was
not a person to whom such a suggestion could
be lightly made. Yet one, out of his affection,
did hint at this hope.</p>

<p>But Whittier’s words shattered the day dream.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, mindful of his frail health.
“I have not married a wife. I will not marry a
nurse.”</p>

<p>The poet’s well-known fondness for young
people was not more marked in later life than in
his Amesbury days. There was a group of
these young people whom he used to call his
“boys and girls,” and in whose achievements
and successes he felt the greatest interest. His
influence over them was not due wholly to that
in his character which commanded their admiration,
or even to his fun and power of repartee.
It came largely from his sympathy with them,
his ability to see things from their point of view.
And who so well as he brimming over with humor
and wit, could enter into and direct their fun?
One of this adopted family has recalled when
several of them sat in the garden room, each
merrily declaring what he or she would do with
a fortune, if that would only befall.</p>

<p>“I should put thirty thousand dollars in the
bank for John G. Whittier,” declared the poet
promptly—thirty thousand dollars being at
that time a much larger sum than it is today.
“And I should buy M—— [the daughter of his
married sister and very fond of pretty gowns]
ten new dresses!” And he laughed with his
listeners.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To a member of this same group, the one to
whom he had given the lilies on the train, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
one day made a prediction. She had told him
she was going to Centre Harbor, then a famous
resort.</p>

<p>“Are thee going alone?” he asked her. She
was; but she was to meet a cousin there. “Thee’ll
lose thy way,” he said. And when she
asserted that she never did that, he persisted,
“Thee’ll lose thy trunk at Dover.”</p>

<p>And she actually did!</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was literally true, for the writer coming
that day into the garden room, found him seated
on the floor with the baby daughter of a relative,
entertaining his young visitor and being entertained
while Miss Larcom looked on smiling.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To one of these young friends to whom he
used to talk of many things in Heaven and on
earth, he once said: “Thy conscience stands in
thy way.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what I can do,” she retorted. “I
can’t get rid of it. I suppose I shall have to let
it stand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>To this he readily assented. His remark may
have been a test.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To waken a dormant power, to teach an unfledged
thought to take wing and fly boldly,
to turn stray impulses into steady purpose for
good, to stimulate youthful promise to become
the worthy performance of maturity, to break
the chains of ignorance and prejudice, as he had
helped to break the iron chains of the slave, was
not only delight to Whittier, it was one of the
objects for which he lived. The men and women
who knew him in their youth and who are still
living have rich memories of words fitly spoken
by which he opened their eyes to opportunities
hitherto unseen, turned their thoughts into
new channels and stimulated them to nobler
performance.</p>

<p>“I like thy courage and perseverance,” he
wrote to a young friend entering the path of
literature, “and what thee say of sometime
writing out thy heart as if nobody were to read
and comment upon it. I suspect that is the
true way; and there are passages in thy letter
which are better than thee dare to print.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of his young friends in whose latent
literary powers he had faith and whom stress
of circumstances had brought into financial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
difficulties, one day came to see him. Another
visitor interrupted their conversation and Mr.
Whittier did not get the opportunity to say to
her what he would have liked to say.</p>

<p>The poet, however, was a man of resources.
The way of speech being blocked, he took the
path of suggestion. He made her a gift of some
new pens—“<i>to try</i>.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But the poet who gathered this circle of young
people about him, holding them by the charm
of his personality, who said that the way to
keep young was to be with the young, who
delighted in youth even to the last, giving
evidence in himself that age is but the youth
of immortality, was yet to youth, as he was to
maturity, a leader—his judgment, not theirs,
dominated.</p>

<p>This was the case one autumn day as he sat
in the garden room smilingly listening to the
pleadings of a bright and interesting member of
that large family of his “boys and girls.”</p>

<p>She wanted the poet to put his autograph at
the bottom of a blank sheet of paper, that something
might be written over it. She most carefully
specified what this was to be. There had
been a joke about something that had taken
place in the summer when both had been at the
mountains, and, not herself, but some one else,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
was to write this page. But she vouched for
exactly what it should be.</p>

<p>Mr. Whittier laughingly turned her from the
point. Until at last she rose to leave. He
accompanied her to the door. The writer seems
still to see the girl standing on the doorstep and
looking with a laugh, and yet a coaxing, into
the face of the poet as she reiterated her plea—and
to see him from the threshold gazing down
upon her, enjoying the light in her clear brown
eyes and the saucy tilt of her head, and answering
with exceeding gravity of tone:</p>

<p>“My name is not worth anything, now that
the Eastern Railroad stocks have gone so low.”</p>

<p>Then both laughed. And the visitor departed—without
the autograph.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In Amesbury lived also the “Jettie” at whose
challenge that he had never written a love poem,
Whittier wrote “The Henchman.” It was of
her the poet sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To Jettie for her dancing nights,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slippers dropped from Northern lights.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Young friends in his own town, and some of
them members of his party in summer places,
with their merry young voices and laughter
helped the poet to many a pleasant hour—although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
it is safe to say that he always did his
share in securing these.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He questioned laughingly a young girl giving
an account of a lecture upon “Chivalry” to
which she had just been listening.</p>

<p>“How would thee like,” he said, “to have a
knight roaming around the world doing exploits
in thy name?”</p>

<p>She retorted that unless he went to serve his
country she would prefer to have him stay at
home. To this he responded at once:</p>

<p>“Thy father [in service of his fellow-men] is
a better knight-errant than any in those days.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A child of ten years whose home was on the
beautiful Merrimac River, a mile from the
poet’s house, one day shyly left her tribute of
loving reverence for him at his door. To her
came the following note:</p>

<p>“John G. Whittier is greatly indebted to his
young friend, Grace M——, for her beautiful gift
of flowers. It is doubly welcome at this inclement
season and she has his thanks and best
wishes. Amesbury, 3rd mo, 29, 1883.”</p>

</div>


<p>The poet had the happiest way of making
people feel at ease with themselves, and so of
bringing out their best. A man often left his
presence feeling himself a more worthy fellow
than he had done when he had entered it. And
so he ought to have been.</p>

<p>But there were times when peculiar exhibitions
of character roused Whittier to keen
comment.</p>

<p>While in Boston he was talking one day to
two ladies at the same hotel. A young woman
just out of boarding school coming to pay them
a visit, was introduced to the poet. But she
was far from comprehending the honor done
her, and it was impossible then and there to
enlighten her.</p>

<p>“Whittier!” she repeated patronizingly. At
the school they had just been reading “Snow
Bound.” It was beautiful—“so fine!” And
she gushed inanely in its praise. Had he read
it? she questioned.</p>

<p>The poet admitted that <i>he had looked it over</i>!</p>

<p>And he admired it, of course? Taking assent
for granted, she next asked Mr. Whittier <i>if he
were any relative of the poet</i>? He answered her
that he had not studied out what relation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“<i>And have you ever seen the Poet Whittier?</i>”
she propounded promptly.</p>

<p>The poet thought that he <i>had</i> met him.</p>

<p>For some time the young woman talked on,
happy in the sound of her own voice and patronizing
still more both poem and poet—to say
nothing of the unknown who bore his name.</p>

<p>In speaking of her the poet remarked that he
always pitied such young women.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Among his many experiences of autograph
hunters he enjoyed the following:</p>

<p>He was on his way to the mountains. It was
a delightful autumn day. The sunshine, the
brilliant colors of earth and sky, the nectar of
the clear and balmy air, all acted upon his
sensitive nerves and brought a keen pleasure
which prepared him for the enjoyment of any
amusing phase of human nature that might
present itself. The train drew up at a junction.
As the poet alighted with that alertness of
movement which to the last distinguished him
and made his way toward his exchange, a young
woman forced a passage through the rushing
crowd and came up to him.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Whittier?” she inquired of him
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The poet assented.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please write your name in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
album?” And she held out her book open at
the desired page.</p>

<p>His dark eyes lighting with amusement passed
swiftly from the puffing train—his train on
which in another moment the bell would ring
and from which the conductor was already
shouting, “All aboard!”—to the eager and entreating
face of the speaker. He appreciated the
situation; he liked her pluck. But what was
he to write with? Fountain pens were then
uninvented.</p>

<p>He flashed his glance about the station; then
with the young woman in tow, hurried to the
telegraph office, seized a pen, dashed off his
autograph, walked swiftly to his train, and in
another moment was being whirled onward.</p>

<p>That must have been one of the occasions
when his hand smote his knee in keen appreciation
of the episode.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Although Whittier never perpetrated matrimony,
he was far from being like the melancholy
Jacques, and much enjoyed looking at happiness
through other men’s eyes—and through
women’s too.</p>

<p>He was vastly amused at the man who complained
to him because a certain young relative
of the poet would persist in quitting the room
by one door at the moment he entered it by
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“The woman ought to do her part!” quoted
the poet with great gusto from the plaint of the
complainer who was too dense to read the
significant scorn of the lady’s conduct to him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A mother boasted to him that she had never
done anything to have her daughters married.</p>

<p>“But thee ought,” retorted the poet.</p>

<p>When one day a young man had come with a
span of fine horses and carried off one of his
nieces to drive, Whittier commented on the event
in his most humorous vein. He didn’t think
she cared for the young man in the least, he said.
The span was the attraction. As for what her
uncle thought of her going, she cared nothing at
all. He didn’t know what he could do about
it—except find a young man with three horses!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But for all the poet’s jesting, love’s young
dreamers were very interesting persons to him.
He once said with a laugh which yet had conviction
under it, that he would have made a good
husband—if he’d been caught young!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He was confident that in many instances he
could have made better matches for certain
young persons than they had done for themselves.
And with his vision that nothing
escaped, his keen perceptions, his infinite tact,
it came about more than once that he turned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
wavering balance of fancy in the head—or
heart—of some young man, or woman, and,
like destiny, resolved uncertainty into joy.
And where he was thus successful, the lovers
themselves had no inkling of his co-operation
and outsiders could only surmise that the poet’s
skill might have had play.</p>

<p>Only once in this skillful manipulation of the
susceptible heart of youth did the credit for his
insinuations recoil upon his own head. A
betrothed couple came one day to pay him a
visit. In the course of this the young man
congratulating himself upon the wisdom and
success of his choice, openly commended his host
for having suggested it to him—and this in the
presence of the intended bride! It was in vain
that the embarrassed poet hastened to repudiate
the charge, of which he could never have been
guilty in the manner of which he was accused.
This only made the young man more insistent.
Whittier’s quickness of retort must have opened
to him some way of escape from the situation.
And he had a consolation; for in telling the
story, he added that during this conversation
the young woman gazed at her betrothed as if
she believed wisdom would die with him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the day of the wedding of the poet’s niece
at his Amesbury home the whole house was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
commotion. The poet in a vain attempt to
restore order was overheard saying with authority
to his cousin, Mr. Cartland, who had
become infected with the general restlessness:</p>

<p>“Thee sit down, Joseph. Thee isn’t going to
be married.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV</h2>
</div>


<p>The poet’s friends and neighbors had for good
and sufficient reasons a peculiar form of invitation
to him. From the doctor’s family—often
through the lips of one of its young members—the
invitation would run:</p>

<p>“Mr. Whittier, we should be so glad to have
you come to breakfast”—or dinner, or tea, as
the case might be—“if you are able to come, if
you are well; but do just as you feel about it.”
Then would follow often the announcement that
some other interesting guest was to be present.
“Do just as you please, Mr. Whittier,” the
messenger of the would-be hostess would always
add anxiously; “but we shall be so glad to see
you.”</p>

<p>The poet never promised. If he were tied,
his headache would be sure to find him out; so,
this method was taken as a charm to outwit the
fiend. Quite often it was successful, and the
poet would be on hand promptly. At other
times the family having waited until it was
believed that he was not coming, would sit down
to table, when the doorbell would ring and Mr.
Whittier appear. At such times he perhaps had
a headache but had decided that it would be no
worse there than at home. And having been
free from obligation, and come because it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
his own wish, he was delightful. To listen to
him was an education—as to listen to him in
the garden room when he talked in his deepest
moods, and often then to one hearer, was an
inspiration.</p>

<p>His unsolicited visits also made red-letter
days. Sometimes on his way home from his
customary walk to the post office in the morning,
or in the evening, he would take the street
leading past the house of some friend. Word
would be tossed about from one to another,
“There’s Mr. Whittier! Is he coming in?”
And eager eyes would watch his movements.
“Oh, he’s going by!” in accents of deep
disappointment—“No, he’s coming in!” in
jubilant tones.</p>

<p>And the visit would be one to be remembered.</p>

<p>It was upon some such occasion that the
poet eagerly caught up a remark by his hostess,
that people liked a good listener.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it, Mrs. S——,” he said, “a good
listener.”</p>

<p>For the poet was quite able to talk, and he
liked to do it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was Whittier’s habit to put on his hat
when he chanced to answer the doorbell.
This might have been on account of his neuralgia
and the northwest wind which often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
swept freely down the street, or—what was
worse to him—the east wind which swept
up it and into the doorway. Or else, being
uncertain who his visitor might be, he would
possibly find it convenient to appear to be
going out. But whatever had been his reason
for donning the hat, upon most occasions it
was promptly laid aside and the visitor was
cordially invited to enter. This visitor was
perhaps a neighbor, or friend, or both in one—or
a stranger who thus spending an hour with
the poet, forever afterward cherished a happy
memory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Readers of Whittier’s poems will recall
one “On a Sun Dial,” beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With warning hand I mark Time’s rapid flight.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In regard to this inscription, Dr. Henry I.
Bowditch wrote his friend in Amesbury—Whittier’s
physician—under date of December
30, 1854:</p>

<p>“Warm regards to Whittier, and tell him I
still <i>hope</i> for the inscription for my old dial—that
is, I wish if you have a fair chance you
would <i>gently allude</i> to my hopes; but, pray,
do not let him think me troublesome about it.
I think I could get one from H——, or F——,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
but I would prefer Whittier to any other that
I know.”</p>

<p>Apparently, the “gentle allusion” must have
been made with success—judging from the following
extract of January fifteenth, 1855,
about two weeks later. “The more I read
Whittier’s lines,” wrote Bowditch to the doctor,
“the more I admire them. Everybody is
delighted with them, and I am obliged to give
copies in every direction.”</p>

<p>With Bowditch’s noble character, his delightful
enthusiasm and anti-slavery zeal, his frankness
and charm, it was not to be wondered
at that the admiration of the two men was
reciprocal. There comes to mind the speech
of the poet, after looking long and earnestly
at a photograph of Dr. Bowditch. He glanced
up at last to say that it made him think of one
of the old Greek fathers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those who knew Whittier well remember
the suddenness of his leave-takings. For, no
matter how tranquilly he was seated and
how absorbed in his subject he appeared, one
could never be sure that the next moment he
would not rise, make his adieus, and be off, all
in a breath.</p>

<p>Somebody asked him one day why he always
took leave so suddenly? He answered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the habit came from early training, that his
father did not like prolixity—no, nor did his
father’s son! Indeed, one day Whittier talking
of himself, said that as he grew older he
could perceive traits of his father coming out
more strongly in himself.</p>

<p>It was the same way with his journeys. An
announcement at the breakfast table would
often be the first intimation that his bag was
packed for the next train. That alertness distinguished
him to the very last. He knew
what he wanted and went straight to the mark.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Yet when in pursuance of his object, the
success of the anti-slavery movement, or helping
to plan and organize that party to which
slavery owed its downfall, no one could navigate
the troubled waters of politics and tack
to fill the sails or avoid the flaws with more
skill than Whittier. The power to manipulate
men he had to a degree that would have
made him dangerous but for his high principle.
For with him honor was always first.</p>

<p>He never lost interest in politics in its highest
sense, nor failed in his part as freeman and
patriot. In 1883 he wrote:</p>

<p>“I have been ill almost ever since the first of
September. I managed to go to the Convention
at Boston and staid only long enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
to vote for Robinson, after which I was ill and
sleepless for four days and nights——more
than one hundred and twenty hours in all. I
am now somewhat better and shall go to Amesbury
this week.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVI">XVI</h2>
</div>


<p>In the long winter evenings when the poet’s
niece was away at boarding school and storm
or some other cause for dearth of visitors had
left him and his housekeeper alone together,
and his eyes would not permit him to read,
or, perhaps when he strove to banish care and
pain and the memory of his loss, he would sometimes
entertain himself and this Scotswoman
with stories.</p>

<p>The more absurd these were, the better for
him. On occasions they were witch stories,
the most horrible New England legends that
memory could recall from his extensive reading
and his imagination color with new vividness.
In the telling of them, manner, tone, words—all
would combine to make her flesh creep
and her hair stand on end.</p>

<p>At last she would laugh.</p>

<p>Then he would turn upon her with assumed
severity. “Margaret, don’t thee believe it?”</p>

<p>“Did you see it, Mr. Whittier?” she would
demand, concerning some marvellous vision
of the unknown upon which he had been dilating.</p>

<p>“No,” he would confess. “But they told me
it was so.”</p>

<p>And he would join in her mirth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>To this never failing sense of humor Whittier
owned somewhat of the clearness of his mental
outlook, and much of his power of retort.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But there is something infinitely touching
in this trying to make the best of things as he
sat by his lonely fireside with the world applauding
him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the winter of 1866-67, being detained in
Boston by a very severe snow-storm, he wrote
to this same housekeeper: “I’m waiting
for proofs of ‘Tent on the Beach.’ Live sumptuously;
patronize the butcher and baker;
and take good care of Charlie [the parrot];
and I’ll be home as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>On his arrival a few days later he greeted
her with: “Well, Margaret, I’ve been ‘snow
bound.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered him. “I don’t know
but you’ll have to write another ‘Snow Bound.’”</p>

<p>Thought carried him to that loved room
where there looked down upon him from the
walls the pictured faces of his mother and his
sister with, to his imagination, somewhat of
the gaze of the far-away reality. He answered
her with a sadness in his tone that she never
forgot. “There’d be only thee and Charlie and
the cat to write about,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>His dear ones were ever the undercurrent
of his thoughts. In 1881 he wrote from Amesbury,
“I am here to be at the election on the
sixth. I like to visit Amesbury.... I
think sadly of the loss of so many dear friends.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And yet, dear heart, remembering thee,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">he wrote of Elizabeth in “Snow Bound.” That
memory, beautiful, Heavenly, never faded with
the years. In his submission to God’s will,
and in his faith, the grief of time grew into the
hope of eternity; but the thought was always
there. In 1887 he said in a letter to the writer
who also had lived in Amesbury: “I often
think of the old days when thy father was
alive and sister Lizzie and we were all together.”
Two years later—only three years before his
own death, he wrote again, “I have not forgotten
the old days in Amesbury.” To those
who had known these he was glad to speak of
them.</p>

<p>The Mrs. C—— across the way from his
home, whose long years of friendship with the
Whittier family have been spoken of, told the
writer how after the death of his mother and
sister, Whittier’s first act on coming home from
an absence was to go into the room in which
hung the portraits of these two, and to stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
before them, not only as if greeting them
on his home coming, but as if also receiving
their welcome to a house in which to him their
presence always lingered and made it home as
was no other place on earth.</p>

<p>From the day of his sister’s death through
all the greater ease of life which came from
his success and his fame, and—far dearer
to him than either—the honor and love which
flowed in to him from all sides, he yet never
failed to feel this loss of home.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So strong was this sense of loss that there was
a time, a few years after the passing of Elizabeth,
when it seemed as if such memories would
prove too much for him.</p>

<p>In the winter of his early sixties he was
stricken with an illness in which his life hung
in the balance. It was no acute disease, but
the vital force in him seemed to have run so
low and his recuperative power to be so little,
that for weeks the doctor, who watched over
him with increasing concern, was very anxious
as to the outcome.</p>

<p>For it was not medicine or even regimen
which was especially needed. It was most
of all lovingness, tenderness, home care that
Whittier required. At that time a touch of
home meant life itself to the home-loving poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
who was actually dying of the loneliness of his
hearthstone. That winter his niece, his housekeeper
when at home with him, was at the
South teaching the freedmen.</p>

<p>At this crisis his nephew’s wife came from
her home in New York and was with him for
months. A trained nurse could not have been
more watchful or more judicious, and no
daughter could have been more kind and tender
in her ministrations. The doctor took heart.
This brooding over the poet, this constant,
tactful interest in him, this cheerful face and
graceful carriage always in his home—of
his own family by marriage if not by birth—was,
as the doctor had foreseen, the one necessity
without which no other help could have
availed, but with which all skill could readily
co-operate. Whittier himself never undervalued
his niece’s ministrations, but always said
that under Heaven he owed his life largely
to her care.</p>

<p>So, the poet came back from the edge of the
Dark Valley where his feet had been treading.
He long outlived the physician who had watched
over him with such solicitude.</p>

<p>In the May of 1868 Whittier wrote to his
sister’s friend and his own:</p>

<p>“Many thanks for thy very interesting letter
from Vineland. I wished I was there when I read
it. It has been dismally cold here most of the
time since thee left. Nothing has been done in
the gardens. The snow, however, is all gone now
and there have been a few days of spring weather.
The grass is springing up, the arbutus is almost
in bloom, and the maple at our door is in full
blossom. I have been a week in Boston and
vicinity and got home last night. I was at
Mrs. Pitman’s and one or two other places,
but generally kept quiet. Yesterday at three
o’clock when I left Boston, the thermometer
was near summer heat; before I got home the
air was full of rain and sleet; and it was winter.
I feel the effects of the change a good deal this
morning.</p>

<p>“There is nothing new here.” Then follow
a few items of news of Amesbury. “When
shall thee return?” he adds. “We miss thee
a great deal. A—— left us a week ago.
Lizzie sends love. She had a great time at
Richmond.” [The niece who had been at the
South teaching the freedmen.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Again in May, six years later, he writes from
Amesbury: “I have been a good deal unwell
this spring, and had to keep house for two or
three weeks. I hope I am getting better....
Yesterday the ministers and laymen came
here in great force. The orthodox houses
were filled with hungry guests, and as the day
was beautiful, they had a good time.... Mrs.
S—— from N—— and Gail Hamilton and Lucy
Larcom were at our house.... Mr. Pickard
has been here and staid two days. This is
the second time he has been here since thee
left.... We had a great thunderstorm on the
last seventh day night. Spring has come in
earnest now. The grass is green on the hills,
the elms are putting out their leaves, and the
maples are in blossom.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In another letter he says that he should
have written before but for his many visitors
and the “overwhelming mass of letters” that
had been pouring down upon him; and also
but for illness—“a hard attack of neuralgia,”
he writes, “which has now nearly passed off,
and a weary time of sleeplessness remains.
I want to go to Amesbury, but cannot until
I feel stronger and better. The extreme cold
of the past month has been very trying....
My dear old friend, Mrs. Pitman, has been very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
sick, but is now improving. Mrs. Fields
has had a severe attack of pneumonia, but is
now thought out of danger. Things, I believe,
remain about the same at Amesbury. I was
saddened by the death of Mr. B——. I shall
miss him much. The C—— boys are still
with Mrs. B——; but a place must be found
for them soon and I hardly know what to do
about it. I hope to get to Amesbury by the
middle of the month.”</p>

<p>This letter was from Oak Knoll in the February
of 1888.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In Whittier’s note to his poem, “Voyage
of the Jettie,” written at Wayside Inn at West
Ossipee, he says that to readers who know the
place it will recall pleasant seasons by the
Bearcamp and Chocorua. And he adds that
to himself the verses have a special interest
“from the fact that they were written, or improvised,
under the eye and for the amusement
of a beloved invalid friend whose last earthly
summers faded from the mountain ranges of
Ossipee and Sandwich.”</p>

<p>This “beloved invalid friend” was the father
of the “C—— boys” mentioned in the above
letter—one of those Amesbury “boys and
girls” in whom the poet showed an unfailing
interest. This gifted young man was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
early victim of tuberculosis. For years in
his failing health he was watched over with
solicitude by the poet, whose letters make
frequent mention of him. On the invalid’s
death Whittier wrote, “I miss him sadly.”</p>

<p>The poet’s care for the orphan boys was
characteristic of his fidelity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“There is nothing especially new in Amesbury,”
he says in a letter to the writer, “except
the one hundredth anniversary of the old Rocky
Hill meeting house for which Mrs. Spofford
wrote an admirable poem. The C——’s are
at Lion’s Mouth. Dr. M—— D—— is in
attendance on her mother who is failing with
consumption. I met A—— and M—— A——
in Portland. I had not seen them for a long
time before. I found Lizzie (Mrs. Pickard)
on the whole better than I had seen her for
years. M—— B—— is seriously ill with
spinal trouble and I fear with no prospect of
recovery. The beautiful June weather is very
welcome after the long and bitter winter and
spring. I enjoy it, but am hardly able to get
about much.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He writes from Oak Knoll:</p>

<p>“I have been here for three or four weeks,
much of the time ill with cold and rheumatism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
I have been close indoors most of the time,
though I went one day to Boston to see my
brother who was troubled with his old enemy,
inflammatory rheumatism.... I shall hope
to see you when I return to Amesbury sometime
this month. Have you seen the Cartlands
yet?... Tell thy mother I will send her by
the Cartlands who are reading it, the ‘Life of Dr.
Norman McLeod’ which I know she will like.
It is one of the pleasantest books I have read
for years.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A letter to M— C— in the May of 1889
records the loss of other friends:</p>

<p>“I have been in Amesbury for a week or
ten days,” he says. “The great Methodist
Conference met here last week with one hundred
and fifty ministers and a bishop. Of
course, I had callers all the week. I suppose
thee have seen in the papers that my sister’s
and my old friend, Mrs. Harriet W. Sewall,
was killed on the railroad crossing at Wellesley.”
And he adds: “Yesterday I had the sad news
of the death of my old friend of sixty years,
President Barnard of Columbia College. So
they all drop away! The spring weather with
its sudden changes is rather hard for me and
I am not feeling quite as strong as usual. I
think the neighbors here are pretty well....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
I hope thee will be home by the time of our
quarterly meeting which takes place on the
fourth Thursday of this month.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After the celebration of his seventieth birthday:</p>

<p>“I am very glad thy golden silence has
become silvern,” he says in a letter to this old
friend. “I was just on the point of writing thee....
What a queer fuss has been made because
I have grown old and got the rheumatism!
I trust it is about over here, but I am now
getting letters from England. I have had
hundreds and many of them I was obliged
to answer. It is all so strange and unexpected.
Of course I am very grateful for the words of
kindness which have reached me. I only
wish I deserved them better. If thee see
M—— G—— again, give her my love, and to
Dr. Furness also, he is a nobleman.... I
have just returned from Amesbury and shall go to
Boston next week. I have had a rather hard
time with headache and other aches but feel
better now. The weather has been below zero
yesterday, but today is springlike again—the
winter wears away very comfortably even
here, and it will soon be spring by the almanac;
but I suppose winter will linger in its lap until
May.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“I had more than one thousand letters on
my birthday!” he wrote to another friend,
“and callers without number. I have not
been able to answer a quarter part of my letters.
I begin to dread to touch a pen.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hail to the coming singers!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hail to the brave light-bringers!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forward I reach and share</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All that they sing and dare.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whittier delighted in the achievements of
others. It was no idle word of his:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thy neighbor’s wrong is thy present hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His bliss thy Heaven.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To crowd out anyone from any good whatever
to make room for himself would have been
impossible to Whittier. He had no rivals;
to him all who strove to help in the world were
coadjutors. Yet, as he said one day in speaking
of his own work and of literary work in
general, “In order to succeed one must have
ambition.”</p>

<p>His judgment of his fellow-poets and writers
was without a shadow of that perhaps unconscious
detraction which would have warped
some natures in seeing these others so plentifully
reaping the harvest of their toils, while
his own garners were at that time comparatively
empty; for, as the world knows, it was only
later in life that these were filled to overflowing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
But he was always so much in love with what
was high and true that he had a share in the
joy of its reward with whomever this was
found. It is easy to appreciate the energy
with which he said, “Emerson is the one American
who will live a thousand years.”</p>

<p>In commenting upon a severe criticism upon
Mrs. Stowe, touching her lack of oversight
and discipline in her own household and its
results, occasionally disastrous, he indulged
in a little quiet amusement at scenes reported,
and then remarked earnestly that a great many
persons could keep house, but how few could
give the world what Mrs. Stowe had given
and was still giving it. Under all circumstances,
her mission was to keep on writing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Does thee see pictures when thee is writing?”
he questioned a young author. And he listened
with attention to her answer that she always
saw them, often vividly, and that the persons
in her stories moved and spoke and acted before
her as if she were looking upon real people.
It was so with himself, he returned; he saw
the places and persons and the scenes he wrote
about enacted before him. He said that he
always had to think with a pen in his hand.
He said also that it made him ill to write.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“So, victory has perched upon thy banners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
and thee have stormed and taken the Patent
Office! I am heartily glad of it,” wrote the
poet to one of his young friends concerning
an invention just patented. But he made
no reference to the fact that a word from himself
had helped to bring to an end some tedious
delays in the path of that victory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He once told an amusing story of the result
of one of his recommendations. A young man
of his acquaintance was in negotiation for a
school in the wilds of New Jersey, and asked
the poet for a reference. This the applicant
readily obtained, and confidently handed to
the school committee who were interviewing
him. “The members passed the letter along
from one to another and looked wise,” said
Whittier, adding with his inimitable silent
laughter, “Not a man of them could read.
But the letter answered the purpose; W——
got his school!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One evening as he sat talking in the garden
room, gazing into his open fire, it furnished
him an apt illustration of the uselessness
of giving people advice contrary to the trend
of their own inclinations. He asserted that
one’s own experience is of no use as a warning
to others. He declared that should one try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
to warn another against the danger of being
burned, the other would question:</p>

<p>“You said you put your hand into the fire?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the adviser would respond.</p>

<p>“And you got it burned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” the first would answer, still
more decidedly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” the adventurer would retort.
“Now I want to put my hand in and see how
it feels.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Through all the changing years Whittier
was the same dear lover of a jest. In his age
he one day handed his photograph to the writer
with the comment: “There’s the old rascal!”</p>

<p>In the July of 1887 in a letter from Centre
Harbor to the writer, whom he had known
from her childhood, he wrote:</p>

<p>“It is too bad that you [her mother and herself]
are in Amesbury and I in Centre Harbor.
It is like the case of John Gilpin whose wife
dined in Eglinton and he in Ware. I came up
here quite ill, but I think I am feeling somewhat
better, though I have not found the
Fountain of Youth in these rocky hills, and
probably should not if I went to Florida, like
Ponce de Leon.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>While he was one day walking in Boston
with a gentleman, he met two of his young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
friends. He not only stopped to speak to
them, as of course, but with care he introduced
his companion to them. In the roar of the
traffic, however, the name of this stranger was
lost to them. But concluding from his associate
and his own appearance that he was a
person of distinction, they scrutinized him as
closely as courtesy permitted.</p>

<p>And they were right. For, later, at their
home, the poet said of his companion in the
city, “That was Canon Kingsley.” He knew
the pleasure it would be to them to learn that
they had exchanged even a word with the great
English author; and he had not allowed the
noise of the street and his own dislike of talking
in it to stand in the way.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The poet dubbed as “specimen bricks”
those innumerable manuscripts which from
all parts were sent to him for commendation
and criticism—some even to be placed. With
his spirit of helpfulness he was much distressed
by these, both because they were often “impossible,”
and also because in any case, he had
not time or strength to attend to them.</p>

<p>But where a special claim held him, it was
wonderful with what persistency of kind effort
he would follow the career of some writer in
whose ability he believed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>His sympathy, once aroused, never failed.
To a person whose literary struggle he had
watched with untiring interest, frequently praising
work accomplished, he sent the following
message of encouragement.</p>

<p>A mutual friend had come to see him. Having
ushered her into the garden room, he sat down
with her and soon began to question her concerning
this writer’s financial success. Finally,
he said to the friend:</p>

<p>“Thee tell F—— that I never made any
money until I wrote ‘Snow Bound.’”</p>

</div>


<p>Nearly a score of years before the Civil War
a dozen men and women at the invitation of
that hospitable pair, Mr. and Mrs. Ashby
of Newburyport, abolitionists, friends of William
Lloyd Garrison, Whittier, and other abolitionists,
drove one day in June to a beautiful spot
on the Newbury shore of the Merrimac River.</p>

<p>There, among the laurels in bloom, they
inaugurated an outing which from that time
for twenty-one years became annual. All the
early members of this small party were abolitionists,
despised and in a sense ostracized.
They sought a day’s recreation by woods and
water where earth and sky welcomed them.
There, forgetful of hardships past and to come,
they gathered at will the mountain laurel, the
blooming of which they had assembled to
celebrate. Little did they imagine how soon
the laurels of a noble fame were to crown their
labors for the slave.</p>

<p>With the years, however, the original dozen
of the first “Laurel Party” expanded into
hundreds of guests, and the once unnoted
recreation of the politically despised few became
a social function to which invitation was
eagerly sought. Whittier’s presence and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
poem, when he wrote for the occasion, were no
small part of the day’s enjoyment.</p>

<p>Among these poems were “Our River,”
“The Laurels,” and “Revisited.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was in 1865, at one of these later crowded
Laurel parties, that the poet gave evidence of
how—even in small things—he held his
faith higher than men’s criticisms of his acts.</p>

<p>A day in June. The heavens were full of
soft clouds which in their brief shadowings
seemed but to intensify the brilliance of the
summer sunshine. Looming against the sky
stood the high bluffs with their dark coronal
of giant pines, their feet caressed by the murmuring
kisses of New England’s most beautiful
river.</p>

<p>Under these pines was gathered a crowd of
people through whose purpose of pleasure in
the day and the scene ran the expectation of
a deeper pleasure through the listening ear
and the quick response of thought to thought.</p>

<p>For they knew that Whittier had brought a
poem. Many persons of reputation in the
world of letters were there; many who ranked
high in social life and some known to the
world of politics. It was a gathering before
which a man would desire to be at his best.
Before it stood the poet who had well proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
himself the inspired voice of the trees and the
birds, the river and the sky. But all knew
that at that time he had uttered a paean for
the victory of Freedom and Union.</p>

<p>Every eye was lifted to Whittier as he stood
erect as the pines above him, lithe in his motions
as the watching birds and with somewhat of
their unexpectedness in movement. In his
hand he held his poem. Would he read it
himself? At first it appeared so to those who
did not know him well. For he stood for a
little time still holding it in his hand. And
in that moment—to the writer at least—was
enacted a by-play, in itself slight enough,
but, if understood, giving the key to the whole
complex character of Whittier.</p>

<p>For the Quaker poet stood with his hat on.
Even in passing his poem to another to be read,
he would be obliged to answer by a few words
the demand made upon him. To do this he
must take off his hat, as other men would do.
His hand was lifted toward it.</p>

<p>Midway, however, it paused—Quakers spoke
with their hats on.</p>

<p>Yet the distinguished gathering before him
was chiefly not of his own sect. A proper
consideration for the customs of society—yes,
even courtesy—demanded this removal;
and to social impressions the poet was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
sensitive. Yet, to one other monitor was he
still more sensitive. That unbending principle
which governed his whole life asserted itself.
Even in so slight a matter he would be true
to his faith.</p>

<p>His hand dropped by his side. It was with
his hat on that he spoke the few apt words
with which he gave his poem to be read.</p>

<p>Small wonder that “Revisited” was a paean
to Him who in the return of peace had given,
not to the anti-slavery party alone, but to
the whole country,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">“... beauty for ashes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the oil of joy for mourning long.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it was small wonder that to the river
the poet sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sing soft, sing low, our lowland river,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Under thy banks of laurel bloom;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Softly and sweet as the hour beseemeth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sing us the songs of peace and home.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Type of the Northland’s strength and glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Pride and hope of our home and race,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Freedom lending to rugged labor</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tints of beauty and lines of grace.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For though by the Master’s feet untrodden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though never His word has stilled thy waves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well for us may thy shores be holy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With Christian altars and saintly graves.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole poem is full of noble thought and
rhythmic beauty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sing on! bring down, O lowland river,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The joy of the hills to the waiting sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wealth of the vales, the pomp of mountains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The breath of the woodlands, bear with thee.”</div>

<p>In 1890, when Haverhill, his native town,
was to celebrate its two hundred and fiftieth
anniversary, Whittier was called upon for
a poem. He wrote to his friend, Col. F——:</p>

<p>“I find I cannot write a hymn or anything
to be sung, but I shall have a poem of perhaps
one hundred lines. I am afraid it will not
amount to much, but it will show my good will
at least. If needed, I can have it ready by the
middle of the month.”</p>

<p>Later, he wrote: “I send the verses for the
celebration. I wish the committee in charge
would print it and send me two copies of the
proof, as I may have to make some slight
changes before it is ready for final printing.
As I cannot read it myself, I must request
that Professor Churchill of Andover may do it
if he is not engaged otherwise.... He is a good
reader and good readers are very rare. I
want it read so well that its faults and failings
shall be forgotten in the fine elocution of the
Professor. I have written it under difficult
circumstances, but I hope it may not be found
amiss for the occasion. Have you had any
correspondence with Haverhill in England?
I think it would be pleasant to have a greeting
from there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>When it was found that Professor Churchill
had already been engaged to read another poem
for the same occasion, Whittier answered the
suggestion of taking another reader:</p>

<p>“I am quite willing that Mr. B—— should
read my rhymes. Mrs. Livermore, I think,
would prefer to speak for herself to reading
other folks’ verses. The committee can do
as they think best. I shall be satisfied anyway.
There are only one hundred and sixteen lines
and they can be read in five minutes.</p>

<p>“I hear that there will be a large gathering
at Haverhill from all the neighboring towns
and cities. If the weather is fine it will be a
great day for Haverhill. I send my picture
of last year. On the whole, I think it is better
to give the author of the ‘Haverhill’ poem
as he is.”</p>

<p>A few days later he wrote: “I send forty or
fifty copies of my poem. You may need some
for the city’s guests and for reporters. If
Mr. B—— is to read the poem, he should have
a copy of it to look over. I was pleased to
meet Mr. Gurteen of old Haverhill. I had
some correspondence with him some years ago.
He brings a beautiful token of good will from
our English namesake with him.”</p>

<p>Mr. B—— went to Whittier’s home and read
the poem to him before reciting it. For when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
anything of the poet’s was to be read in public,
Whittier was desirous to have it given as he
intended it, and, when he could, he liked to
meet the reader and listen to his rendering of
it. He would point out changes here and
there, saying of a certain passage, “I meant
it so,” and of another, “I meant that so.”
And the reader must have been dense indeed
if he did not catch the meaning, and unappreciative
if he ever forgot those wonderful intonations
and renderings of the poet’s verse
by the poet himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXI">XXI</h2>
</div>


<p>Whittier would never take part in an “Authors
Reading,” or in anything that had the least
publicity. It was only in the garden room at
Amesbury that he would read aloud a poem
of his own. Or it may have been under the
pines at Intervale towering like the forest
primeval, or in some other quiet nook among
the hills, with a little group of listeners about
him—or perhaps with only one eager listener.
Then his voice would rise and fall in notes and
cadences which gave a wonderful power to the
rendering of his own poems and a new perception
of beauty in what had already seemed
beautiful, a new awe and sublimity in what
had before seemed grand.</p>

<p>When in the garden room he read “The
Palatine” to an entranced listener, his voice
made the scene live before her eyes; and in
the inevitable retribution following sin prepared
the way for that thought which pierces
to the depth of life. Never again can that
poem give forth its weirdness, its tragic, and
awful pathos as it did in the tones of its author.
There was nothing of “elocution.” His reading
was word painting; one shivered when he
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Is there, then, no death for a word once spoken?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was never a deed but left its token</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Written on tables never broken?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His housekeeper, the Scotswoman before
referred to, told how one day she had read Mr.
Whittier an account in the paper of a weird
light mysteriously seen at sea; and she added,
“He wrote a poem about it.”</p>

<p>This was “The Palatine.”</p>

<p>One day after reading “The Pennsylvania
Pilgrim” to the writer, he told her that he had
written the poem to please himself in the
story of what was dear to him, and that he did
not so much care if people did not like it.</p>

<p>Indeed, the greatness of his fame never kept
him from a certain depreciation of his own work,
which declared itself in speech and often in his
letters. The world sang his praises; but he held
to his own verdicts.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p class="p0">he writes in the “Proem” of his published poems.
He loved best the songs for which he could find
no words—like all true poets. Who can say
that he may not now be singing these in the
music of a new tongue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>No less than he loved Milton’s poetry did
Whittier love the great poet’s sonorous prose.
As has been said before, Whittier’s rendering
of his own poems brought forth their swing
and rhythm and their innermost meaning
with a vividness that no one else could give
them. To watch the poet as he thus rendered
one of his own poems, to listen to the intonations
which deepened the melody of the verse was an
experience not to be forgotten.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One day Whittier told the writer of his having
begun a poem—his biographer also tells this—upon
the banishing of the Arcadians from their
country. But he added that he had abandoned
it on learning that Longfellow was writing
“Evangeline.” His listener realized the fervor
of Huguenot indignation (for Whittier had Huguenot
blood in his veins) which would have inspired
his muse at the wrongs of those innocent
people and the pathos with which he would
have told their story, and expressed her regret
that he had not written the poem.</p>

<p>But he answered with decision: “No; it
was better so. Longfellow has done the work
as it should have been done.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One day the doctor said to the poet: “You
have written so much, Mr. Whittier, that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
suppose you write now without labor—that
writing is easy to you?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Whittier emphatically.
“Everything is labor to me. I don’t know any
easy writing.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In addition to this careful work—rather,
as a part of it—no one realized better than the
poet the difference between a poem in manuscript
and the same poet in print. So, he would
often say to one of his young neighbors—a
printer—“Fred, I want to see thee a minute.”
And he would hand the young man the poem—or
a portion of it—to put into type, so that
the poet before sending it to the publishers
might judge for himself how it would look
printed. He used to say, appreciative of the
glamour of acceptance, that print improved
things.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was once at least, however, when he
waited for no such self-criticism, when the
spirit moved him so strongly that it swept away
all but the emotion it kindled in his heart—there
was once, at least, that it was “easy
writing” for him so far as the flowing of his
pen was concerned, which could not go fast
enough to keep pace with the rush of his thoughts—although,
no doubt, he paid by days of headache<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
for the all but involuntary toil of his spirit.
It was when he wrote his paean for the passage
through Congress of the Constitutional Amendment
abolishing slavery.</p>

<p>That morning the poet came home from the
Fifth Day (Thursday) meeting of the Friends,
his eyes large with excitement—as one who
saw him told the writer—and, as if the thought
in his heart and the words on his lips were too
overwhelming to be true, he cried:</p>

<p>“What are the bells ringing for? The flags
are up—and away up!”</p>

<p>Then when there was no longer question as
to the meaning of the flags and the bells, he
sat down at his desk and wrote like one inspired—as,
indeed, he was. I think his biographer
tells, as did also one in the house, that there
was no walking back and forth in the room,
as was often the case when he was writing,
but the words flowed upon the paper as fast as
his pen could move.</p>

<p>When the poem was written, it was sent to
the publisher with scarcely a revision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in his own town, as people with
moist eyes and glad hearts listened to the bells
of freedom, they said one to another:</p>

<p>Whittier is writing a poem!</p>

<p>Thus was “Laus Deo!” born.</p>

<p>When George MacDonald came to America
upon his lecture tour and brought with him his
wife and son, he consented to give his lecture
in Amesbury, although the lecture committee
there could by no means pay him his price.
But the fact that Whittier had invited him
while in Amesbury to be his guest more than
compensated for the meagerness of financial
rewards. In truth, it was often the case that
the hospitality of the poet compensated for the
poverty of the lecture bureau, and the Amesbury
lyceum had speakers of far higher ability
than its own funds could have supplied.</p>

<p>MacDonald’s lecture was most interesting,
and simply delivered in his fascinating Scottish
accent.</p>

<p>In the evening a deputation from the Scottish
Club of Amesbury came to him in the poet’s
home, bringing Whittier’s complete works to
present to the poet and novelist of their native
land. Whittier’s welcome and the Scottish
poet’s delight made the event a “red-letter day”
to the Club.</p>

<p>But when the two poets were at last alone
together, they must have spent a memorable
time; they had in common an untraveled world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
of sympathy; yet they were different. The
spiritual world is MacDonald’s world and his
heroes are ideal rather than weighted with the
weaknesses and foibles of human nature. But
Whittier tells us of reality—the reality in the
natural and in the spiritual world, for in both
of these he lived. His poems are no dreams,
but actualities seen upon the heights of life.
His men and women are those whom we daily
meet, but with the veil which for most of us
is upon their hearts drawn aside, giving us wonderful
glimpses into the holy of holies. It was
not strange that the two poets had much to
say to each other, and that afterward Whittier
remarked of his guest; “There is no man in
England whom I should have been more glad
to meet than George MacDonald.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In connection with this visit occurred an
incident characteristic both of Whittier and
of his niece, afterward Mrs. Pickard, who
herself told it to the writer.</p>

<p>The poet received many very beautiful
gifts, some of which this niece while keeping
his house would put about in the rooms, that
visitors also might enjoy them. But Whittier’s
native abhorrence of ostentation, together with
his Quaker simplicity, did not approve of this
display, and the gifts would be relegated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
their hiding-places. Over and over would
she try the experiment, and always with the
same result, although occasionally, her uncle
would not immediately notice the ornaments
and so they would hold their own for a few
days; but only to disappear in the end. Thus
the game would go on and neither would mention
the subject to the other.</p>

<p>Among these gifts was a very handsome
silver cake-basket, for cake-baskets were
then in vogue. Several times had Lizzie
attempted to grace the table with this when
guests were present. But her uncle had always
left his guests to make an errand to the dining-room
just before the meal, and the tabooed
basket had always vanished from the table.</p>

<p>But when George MacDonald, accompanied
by his wife and son came to Amesbury to give
his lecture, because, as has been said, he could
be the guest of Whittier, Lizzie felt that if the
opportunity to display the cake-basket was
ever to come, it should be then. But how
could she do it? For her uncle, with all his
pleasure in his guests was not too much absorbed
in his brother poet to omit the preliminary
survey of the table.</p>

<p>The cake-basket was not there. Well-pleased,
he returned to his guests.</p>

<p>It was when the summons to the evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
meal had been given and the company was
about to be seated, that Lizzie appeared, in
her hand the well-filled cake-basket which
she placed conspicuously upon the table and
made haste to seat herself behind the teacups.</p>

<p>If the poet, who never missed the humorous
side of anything, did not strike his hand upon
his knee and cry his familiar utterance, “Capital!
Capital!” it was because at the moment the
situation made it impossible to him. He surely
appreciated his niece no less because she—one
of his own family—had done what his
foes, political and personal, had never been
able to accomplish—outwitted him!</p>

<p>Whittier sometimes received suggestions for
his poems from stories told him directly, possibly,
for the purpose, as was the case with
the episode of “Barbara Frietchie.” But, no
doubt, persons often gave him suggestions for
poems without suspecting that they were doing
so.</p>

<p>“I should think the old captain would come
out of his grave, Mr. Whittier,” cried indignantly,
Mrs. M——, a neighbor and friend, as
she sat one evening in the garden room making
complaint of a use, or, rather, of a disuse of
something over which the members of the Improvement
Society of the town—she being
one—who were busy looking up its many antiquities,
were very wrathful. “Yes, I should
think he would come out of his grave,” she
repeated, “to see that old well of his which
he dug himself for the free use of the public
all covered over with rubbish in this way. It
ought to be opened up.”</p>

<p>She went on to free her mind still more concerning
public rights and the neglect of these,
as illustrated in the case of the old well dug
by Valentine Bagley for the wayfarer, so that
none who passed by might have to endure a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
tithe of the agony of thirst that he himself
had known when at one time lost in the desert.
Then in his distress he had vowed that should
he ever return to his home, he would dig a well
as a thank-offering. This was the well.</p>

<p>But what had been intended for a boon had
become useless from neglect—a disfigurement.</p>

<p>The poet was deeply interested. “Yes,”
he answered her, “it ought to be opened.” And
in a moment he added, “We will have it opened.”</p>

<p>And in his own beautiful way Whittier told
the true story of Valentine Bagley, an old-time
worthy of Amesbury, of his shipwreck, his
desert wanderings, his final rescue, and the
carrying out of his resolve to save others from,
at least, one of his many sufferings—thirst.
The poem tells how by the side of the road
running from what was then the village to the
old ferry crossing the Merrimac, the returned
wanderer dug this well for the benefit of all
who were thirsting as they passed by it.</p>

<p>But it had been choked up by neglect and
abuse.</p>

<p>Whittier’s poem, however, rescued it from
this neglect and lifted it into fame.</p>

<p>This is how “The Captain’s Well” came to
be written. And the thousand dollars which
the poet received for it from the “New York
Ledger” served also some other benevolence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>Of this poem he wrote to his sister’s dear
friend and his own:</p>

<p>“I enclose a copy of ‘The Captain’s Well,’
though perhaps thee have seen it. There were
some mistakes in it. Hundreds of copies of
it have been sold in Amesbury and as many in
Newburyport. I don’t think much of it
myself. When will you [herself and party]
return?” [from Bermuda], he adds. “We miss
thee very much and shall be glad to see thee
back again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Among the relics kept in the Whittier Home in
Amesbury, the house now owned and opened to
the public by the “Whittier Home Association”
of that town, is an old cradle that belonged
to Valentine Bagley, the hero of “The Captain’s
Well.” And in the Amesbury burying ground,
not far from the poet’s own grave, is the grave
of this Valentine Bagley, with an epitaph in
the style of many others of that time. It reads:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“His languishing head is at rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its thinking and aching is o’er,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His quiet, unmovable breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is moved by affliction no more.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a letter to the writer, to whom Whittier
spoke frequently of his own work, he said of a
song of his, “My poem in the ‘Atlantic’ is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
very nice one—matter of fact and not poetical;
but it tells a sorry story of the old time.” This
is an illustration of how his world-wide fame
never convinced him that he had reached
the highest upon his own lines; he always looked
beyond for it—happily for himself and for the
world.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In a letter written December, 1881, he says:</p>

<p>“I have passed a quiet birthday on the seventeenth.
It is always a serious matter—passing
these milestones of life. At my age I cannot
look forward to many more. I send thee a
copy of what is called my ‘Birthday Book.’
It does not amount to much—mere shreds
and patches, but it is pretty so far as the publishers
are concerned. I go to Amesbury some
day the last of this week, if the weather is right
and I feel able. Sometime when I am there
I should be glad to see thee. I hope to be in
Boston in February, and Lizzie also hopes to
be there. If so, we will be glad to see thee,
and will let thee know.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In a letter written from Oak Knoll in the
March of 1886, he speaks of what might have
been his niece’s fatal accident in an elevator.</p>

<p>“I should have written thee before,” he says,
“but my strength was not equal to my wish
and writing has been almost out of the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
with me this winter. I think of my old friends,
however, always. I went to Boston for the
first time for more than a year, to meet Lizzie;
but my lameness and sleeplessness drove me
back soon. Lizzie’s accident upset me a good
deal, but I am so thankful it was no worse. It
was a great escape....</p>

<p>Of course I shall send thee the very small
volume of poems [‘Saint Gregory’s Guest’]
as soon as it is printed.” And he adds with
that self-distrust so wonderful in one of his
genius and world-wide fame: “It is a poor
affair, I fear, but if it was a mistake, it is not
likely to be repeated. I only wanted to speak
to my old friends once more. Thy old and
loving friend.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Now on one hand, now on the other, the poet
gathered the material for his poems; sometimes,
as we know, these came from incidents told
him by those among whom he lived, or by
strangers. But often legend furnished the subject;
or, best of all, the inspiration of the Spirit
which taught him high and holy thoughts.</p>

<p>To one who asked him if his poem “Among
the Hills,” was taken from life, he answered
that it was as this ought to be, and went on
to speak of the hopeless drudgery of the farmer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
life as he had seen it in his youth, and of the
poverty of ideals in that life, sometimes its
actual squalor. In his own home, however,
the ideal had always existed; and life there,
however simple, was never destitute of attractions,
or of that intercourse with a wider outlook
which enlarged its own horizon.</p>

<p>Is it to be supposed that he knows nothing
today of how the farmer’s horizon has widened,
how distance has become lessened, if not annihilated,
and how the news of the world is left
at his doorstone? It has been wisely said that
poets are the true prophets; they have visions
of the blessings to come upon the world.</p>

Yet those who know say that his pen pictures
of Italy are perfect. He is a consolation and
an inspiration to them upon whom life’s limitations
press.</p>

<p>Judging by his reading, the world of books
was indeed his world. Books alone were never
his world, however; he chose “living guests
who love the day;” and he had them. For
from East and West men and women of thought
and power and accomplishment came to him
who could not go to them. And not even
personal presence or telegraph or telephone
did he require to draw about himself a network
of communication with the best and most
interesting of the world’s thinkers and workers.
In all parts beyond his sight, he knew them
by letter and message. Through travelers
and books the world of his picturing was not
far from the real world. But especially did
he perceive it through that imagination which
saw</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>
<p>One day there came to visit him at Oak Knoll
a widely traveled man. Whittier talked with
him concerning the many nations and races
his guest had seen; for his last experiences
had been among the Asiatics. The poet with
deepest interest questioned him of the aim and
character in its broadest lines of those he had
known. As the two talked, one broadened
by travel and personal intercourse with many
peoples, the other by power of intellect and
especially by love of God and of men, differences
of race and creed and nationality fell away
from the eyes of both, like the calyx from the
opening flower. They saw that in the hearts
of all men bloomed deathless humanity, making
the men of the East at one in all essentials with
men in Massachusetts, or anywhere else—that
invincible humanity oversweeping all minor
differences.</p>

<p>As Whittier relating the conversation to the
writer, repeated this testimony, he gave it
great weight, as another evidence of the oneness
of all human beings, and of that brotherhood
which one day is to be realized by us.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He was deeply interested in the poem which
he sent Dr. Bowditch, that Eastern poem of
Edwin Arnold’s, beginning,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p class="p0">to comfort them with the voice of one who
having passed beyond this life, finds himself
still dwelling in life—not in death.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“When I come to Amesbury,” said Whittier
in one of his letters, “I shall bring some books
for the Library” [the Amesbury Public Library].</p>

<p>He added: “I got a mayflower over three
weeks ago from Pennsylvania. I don’t suppose
the Folly-Mill flowers will bloom for a month
or more.” The mayflowers in “the woods
of Folly-Mill,” a few miles from the poet’s
home, were very abundant and beautiful.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the old Amesbury burying-ground by
the road leading to Merrimac—then called
“West Amesbury”—slept his mother and
sisters and others of his family. Here he himself
was to be laid one day—as now he rests.</p>

<p>He loved the Amesbury house in which his
dear ones had lived. Here, with also much
of his earlier work, he had written “Snow-bound,”
“The Tent on the Beach,” and many
of his later poems. The place was filled with
treasured memories and inspiration to further
work. There was in it, as the writer has heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
him say, a dearness and a sacredness belonging
to no other spot.</p>

<p>Even in quitting it for a time, as he did
at the marriage of his niece, Lizzie—Mrs.
Pickard—he did not shut himself out from it.
But for this house which was still to be home
for him when from time to time he should return
there, he chose tenants who, as far as possible,
made it so to him—Judge Cate and his wife.</p>

<p>He liked to discuss politics, local and national,
with Judge Cate. And all who visited him
in Amesbury during these years could but be
grateful to Mrs. Cate for her attention to the
poet’s comfort and pleasure, a thoughtfulness
exercised with tact and delicacy. In her consideration
of him she might have been a daughter
to the lonely saint.</p>

<p>Yet, one day the eyes of a guest of his grew
dim as sitting at table with him, there came
the keen remembrance of his loneliness. Not
one of his own kith and kin was there to minister
to him so loyal to them.</p>

<p>Whittier used to say that those born under
the shadow of Powow Hill always came back
to die. It is well known that this was what he
wished to do—to die in the same house from
which his mother and his sister had passed to
the life beyond.</p>

<p>This wish was not fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>Yet it was not half a score of miles away,
at the beautiful home of a relative and one of
his own faith, that he passed from death to life.
And it was here, in his own dear house, that
his friends assembled to pay him the last honors.
And it was from this house that he was borne
to</p>

and faith and help he has given to the world!
And no man can give, save from what he himself
possesses.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lovers of the poet owe a debt of gratitude
to those of his townspeople who are members
of the “Whittier Home Association.” For
they have made of his beloved Amesbury home
a memorial of Whittier’s life, and have gathered
here valued mementos of the poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>The Association under the guidance of its
president, Mrs. Emily B. Smith, able, cultured,
full of enthusiasm in her work, a social leader,
has made the Whittier Home the gathering-place
for whatever can best minister to spiritual
power and social refinement. Men and women
of distinction are glad to bring here of their
work and so to bear witness to their love for the
poet.</p>

<p>Here—one of these guests, as speaker at
the Midsummer Meeting of the Association—came
Calvin Coolidge, the summer before his
election as Governor of Massachusetts, and
bore testimony to his appreciation of Whittier
as poet and man.</p>

<p>Here pilgrims from all parts of the country
and from all lands are welcomed. From here
they depart with new knowledge of the poet
in his own home and greater appreciation of
the man whose life of self-sacrificing service
prepared him for the utterance of that last
message of his—“Love to the world.”</p>

<p>In Amesbury also “The Elizabeth H. Whittier
Club” keeps alive memory and thoughts of
Whittier and of that dear sister of his, his
cherished companion, and, like him, a poet.</p>

<p>It is fitting that this club should be also “The
Woman’s Club” of Amesbury. For Elizabeth
Whittier in spite of all her retiring gentleness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
was quick to exhibit at need that devotion to
the right and that courage of her convictions
which must be the guiding influence of the
womanhood, the inspirer and companion of
manhood in his best achievements.</p>

<p>Shortly before the marriage of his niece
Lizzie to Mr. Pickard in the April of 1876,
Whittier in a letter to Mrs. F——, expressing
pleasure at hearing from her and sending her
the requested autographs, announced:</p>

<p>“I am not going to give up my residence in
Amesbury. But I expect to spend some time
with my cousins at their delightful home,
Oak Knoll, in Danvers. Lizzie sends love. She is
busy with her preparations for a change of base.”</p>

<p>Soon after her marriage he said in a letter
from Oak Knoll to his old friend, M—— C——:</p>

<p>“I have felt rather lonesome since, but am
pretty sure it is all for the best.... I went to
Boston to the Convention to choose delegates
to Cincinnati a week ago yesterday. We
elected the men I wanted. The next day I
came out here, and found violets and anemones
and bloodroot in bloom and the lawn green
with grass. Day before yesterday I spent
with the Sewalls at Melrose to meet Mrs. Pitman
and Mrs. Childs. I had a delightful time.
I am now suffering with a cold brought on by
the bitter east wind. I long for the south-east
ones. M—— P—— [a niece] is quite
ill; I fear, seriously. Joseph and Gertrude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Cartland are still at Amesbury, and probably
thee will find them there when thee return,
which I hope will be ere long.”</p>

<p>A letter from Whittier to the writer in the
April of 1881—an extract from which Mr.
Pickard published in his biography of the poet—says:</p>

<p>“I have just got thy pleasant letter. I am
afraid I cannot answer it very well for I am
under the baleful influence of our reluctant and
baffling New England spring and my head is
in no condition to think. I was at Amesbury
nearly a month, most of the time seeing nobody
and rather glad of it, as I was overdone with
folks at Boston.</p>

<p>“I quite agree with what thee say of ‘The
Little Pilgrim’ and the life beyond generally.
But I like ‘The Little Pilgrim’ story better than
Dante’s pictures of Heaven—an old man
sitting eternally on a high chair and concentric
circling saints, martyrs, and ordinary church
members whirling around him in perpetual
gyration and singing ‘glory!’ Ah me! It is
idle to speculate on these things. All I ask for
is to be free from sin and to meet the dear ones
again.... I am not able to do much—even
reading is often painful; but the east winds
will soon blow themselves out, and I shall
feel better, I trust.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>In another letter he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have just sent a poem to the ‘Atlantic’
which perhaps nobody will like. But I do and
that is enough, as I wrote it to free my mind.”
The poem was “Rabbi Ishmael.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In 1880 in a letter from Oak Knoll to the
writer, he says: “I wonder whether you are
enough in the country at Au—to see the progress
of spring in grass and bud and blossom. Have
you birds about you? Here we have a good
many. Last night a pretty rabbit came up
under our windows and the gray squirrels are
plenty. I have been hoping to get out to see
you; but if I cannot, you must come here.
Two of our folks are in California this spring.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Of all the birds he speaks in his letters most
of the bluebirds, those messengers of spring.
In a letter in 1881, he says: “The winter has
been rather hard on me and I have suffered
from the inability to get out of doors much.
I shall be glad to hear the bluebirds.” At
another time, “The bluebirds are singing in
our pines.” And again, “The bad weather
has made me ill; and I shall not try Boston
again until the bluebirds come.” Still again,
“The weather now looks like spring. A bluebird
sang today on our grounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>In the April of 1884 he wrote from Oak Knoll:</p>

<p>“I hoped to be in Boston at this time but I
hardly feel strong enough to go away at present.
Somehow the long, dark winter and spring have
been rather hard upon me. Today I am
rejoicing in the sunshine and hope it has come
to stay. Unlike Lowell in his ‘Bigelow Papers,’
I don’t</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">‘... like our springs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That kind o’ haggle with their greens and things.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But I believe other places are no better than
New England this season. Letters from Florida,
Carolina, and New Jersey all complain of the
cheerless weather. Lizzie [his niece] has been
for some weeks at Statesville, N. C., but is
probably now on her way home. A part of the
time the water froze in the pitcher in spite of a
fire on the hearth. Then warmer weather with
awful thunder-showers and hail stones three
inches in diameter and mud so deep that she
could not ride out. I shall be at Amesbury
most of May, probably.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is worth while to realize how frail he was,
that we may realize better how wonderful was
the work he accomplished. Any man might
well be thankful that it had been given him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
help to carry through one reform—that of
helping to give freedom to the slave.</p>

<p>But Whittier did not stop there. He had
been so faithful in one mission that, as reward,
another was given to him, in a sense, along the
same lines, yet on a spiritual plane. In following
the footsteps of his Master, he was still a disciple
of freedom. Having known sorrow, he
was taught how to comfort; he spoke to souls
in prison and led them forth into the clearer air
and sunlight. Neither health, nor strength, nor
wealth, nor happiness, as the world counts these
things, did Whittier require for his work. He
leaves without excuse those who shrink from a
lesser mission. Yet for them he himself would
be the first to find a plea.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the August of 1879 he wrote: “I am half
sick and must try some change. I may go to
New Hampshire in a few days if I feel able.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the June of another year, in a letter from
Intervale, he says:</p>

<p>“I came up here hoping to find strength in
this region of mountains. But I cannot say
that I have succeeded as yet. The Intervale
House on the whole I like much better than the
house at North Conway village. Mount Washington
shows to best advantage here and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
thick pine woods near are a comfort. There are
but few people here yet; it has been too cold.
The snow lies white on Washington. I expect
Joseph and Gertrude Cartland this week. I do
not know how long I shall remain here. Lizzie,
who is still ill, is at Fryeburg only twelve miles
from here.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The pines mentioned in this letter from Intervale
were almost adjoining the hotel there—magnificent
trees, old enough for the Indians to
have loved and left in their beauty. They are
the entrance to woods so extensive and so dense
that one day the poet, perceiving that a member
of his party who had been sitting under a huge
pine tree had vanished, came hurrying, breathless,
up the slope to give warning not to go into
the woods, as there was real danger of being
lost in them.</p>

<p>The visit to Intervale to which he refers, and,
later, that to Fryeburg, was during the summer
of President Garfield’s illness. Those who saw
the poet then will never forget his indignation
and his sorrow over the martyred and suffering
hero, nor the depth of his sympathy which
rendered Whittier himself well-nigh ill.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After this time he wrote:</p>

<p>“I was foolish enough to take cold some five
weeks ago and have not got over it yet. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
season, so damp, so hot and cold by turns, has
been a hard one for invalids, and, added to this,
the depressing influence of the good President’s
suffering and death. I think with thee that the
death of the President is uniting the nation.
God is overruling all for good.... I
often think of our visits to the pines at Intervale
and our ride up to Dr. Buzzell’s hill in Fryeburg.”</p>

<p>This drive was through a beautiful country, a
portion of the way, however, winding through
what must have been a magnificent forest before
the fire fiend swept over the giants of the wood
and left blackened stumps and great trunks of
trees leafless and well-nigh branchless, pointing
their blasted tops to the sky like arms uplifted
to call down pity and help. But for all these
ghosts of former days, the drive in the summer
sunshine was a delightful experience, with
summer foliage for a good part of the way, with
hills at hand and the distant mountains.</p>

<p>The “Joseph and Gertrude” of whom the poet
so often speaks in his letters were Mr. and Mrs.
Cartland, both his cousins. They had spent
the winter preceding his niece’s marriage with
him in Amesbury. And during the latest years
of his life he passed weeks and months at their
home in Newburyport. They were frequently,
perhaps always in later years, with him in his
summerings among the hills. At one time principals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
of the Friends School in Providence, they
were delightful in manners and conversation,
their culture from books and social life mingling
with their Quaker demureness, and, flashing
through this, a brightness all their own. It was
interesting to watch that likeness in unlikeness
between Mr. Cartland and the poet, although,
oddly enough, it was the former who recalled the
poet, and never the poet him.</p>

<p>Jettie M—— for whom he wrote “The Henchman”
and for whom the boat of his poem,
“Voyage of the Jettie,” was named, was sometimes
one of his summer companions among the
hills.</p>

</div>


<p>Being obliged on account of ill health to
decline a visit to old friends, he wrote to them:</p>

<p>“I would like to see how Haverhill looks at
this delightful season [October] and enjoy with
old friends there the wonderful glory of the
autumnal woods. But I find that I have to let
a great many pleasant things drop out of my
life. I thank God for such as remain, and,
especially, for the love and goodwill of my
friends, among whom I am glad to reckon the
inmates of the F—— homestead. With love to
thee and the Col. and C——, I include myself
in Tiny Tim’s benediction, ‘God bless us every
one!’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I went to the country for three or four
weeks,” he said in 1885 in a letter to the writer,
“and came back feeling better for it, but for the
last three weeks have fallen back and the first
hint of cold weather makes me dread the coming
winter and feel that I have little assurance of
another season of leaves and flowers. If I live a
few weeks longer I shall be seventy-eight!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was that same year that he wrote again to
his Haverhill friend in regard to the reunion of
the surviving students of the Haverhill Academy
in 1827-28.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“I thank thee for thy kind invitation,” he
says, “but I have been so ill for the last week
that I am quite unfit for going anywhere. I
shall try to be at my old friend Wingate’s tomorrow,
but I shall not venture to do anything
more. It would give me no small pleasure to
visit you, but I cannot do it. I hope there will
be a very quiet meeting of the old scholars and
nothing of a public nature. We don’t want to
make a show of our old selves in the least. The
thing is no plan of mine.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A few years later he wrote to the same:</p>

<p>“My dear friend, Charles Wingate, has passed
on peacefully and hopefully. His departure
leaves me nearly alone in that old generation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wingate was of the family of “The
Countess” of Whittier’s beautiful poem.</p>

<p>“I attended the Haverhill reunion,” he writes
shortly after that event, “but I have suffered
for it since; the fatigue and excitement were too
much for me.”</p>

<p>For this occasion he wrote the poem, “Reunion,”
ending:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hail and farewell! We go our way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where shadows end, we trust, in light;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The star that ushers in the night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is herald also of the day!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>
<p>Two years later, in the latter part of July,
1887, the poet wrote from Centre Harbor:</p>

<p>“I got away from the hotel before the fire.
We are stopping here at the Sturtevant Farm
near Holderness. It has been hot and damp for
the last week. The fields are green as June, but
too wet for comfort.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thus, in spite of being “half sick,” as he was
sometimes—and sometimes wholly so, he had
many happy days among the friends who gathered
about him in the quiet summer resorts
which he frequented as long as he had strength
for the journeys. Occasionally, he went to
Appledore, one of the most beautiful of the Isles
of Shoals. Here the retreat of Mrs. Thaxter’s
cottage kept him from the crowd. But more
often he went to the hills; and this was
especially true in his later years.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I have been ill a good deal of the past month,”
wrote the poet in the December of 1881, “and
in addition I suffer from lameness in my knee.
I begin to suspect I am growing old in earnest.... I
have not been in Boston for nearly a
year and have hardly courage to attempt it.
Did any of you hear Archdeacon Farrar? He
and Phillips Brooks came to see me and I was
much pleased with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>In another letter Whittier says:</p>

<p>“I have been reading with a great deal of
satisfaction Phillips Brooks’s ‘Sermons,’ not
always agreeing with him, but liking his spirit
and earnest convictions. He is a rare man.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>More than a year later Whittier wrote:</p>

<p>“I ought long ago to have written thee, but
the sickness and death of my brother and my
own illness have made my winter here a hard
and sad one and compelled me to neglect my
correspondence.... Lucy Larcom is in
the city at Concord Square. I saw her last
week. Do you ever come into the city? If so
will you not call on me? I have not been about
the city at all, but many of my old friends have
called on me. What there is to see or hear I do
not know. In some respects I might as well be
in Amesbury as here. But I hope I am getting
somewhat over my fatigue and illness, and am
very thankful for it, and for the many blessings
of my allotment.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A letter in the March of 1883 regretting missing
a friend who had called at the hotel to see
him, adds:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t thee call here? Anybody comes
here who wishes to. If thee are in town again
try this place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“This place” was the Mt. Vernon Street home
of former Governor and Mrs. Claflin, where the
poet was always so cordially welcomed and so
tactfully entertained that he frequently visited
there. Mrs. Claflin appreciated the privilege of
the presence of the “old saint,” as she rightly
named the poet, in her home. Her “Personal
Recollections” of Whittier give a just estimate
of his character and many interesting
reminiscences.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I really think this pleasant day is the beginning
of the end of our long winter,” wrote the
poet from Oak Knoll to the writer in the February
of 1887. “I for one am glad to think so.
My cousins, Mrs. W——, Miss J——, and Phebe
have been for some weeks in Bermuda where
they only complained of too much warmth.
They expect to return the latter part of this
month. I have been shut in in the cold and
snow, but am freer now from pain than I was at
the outset of winter. The want of exercise in
the open air I feel of course very much.</p>

<p>“I scarcely know what is going on in the literary,
political, or theological world. I feel sometimes
that I have a word to say that is needed, but
I have not felt strong enough to write. So, the
world must get on without my shoulder to the
wheel, and I guess it will.... I wish I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
could look in upon you and see you all together
as formerly. I am glad to think of you in health,
which after all is the main thing.”</p>

<p>The poet with his usual thought of giving
pleasure enclosed jasmine blossoms from Bermuda
in his letter.</p>

<p>A portion of this letter Mr. Pickard quotes in
his biography of the poet.</p>

<p>So sings Whittier in “The Vanishers.”</p>

<p>Yet while most spiritual, his judgment of
spiritualism in its accepted meaning is given in a
letter which after the death of his mother he
wrote to the dear friend of his sister and himself.
She was an ardent spiritualist and, evidently,
had been endeavoring to console the poet and
his sister through this faith.</p>

<p>“Thy sympathy and tender solicitude have
been fully appreciated by us,” he wrote of himself
and Elizabeth. “But at this time our
sorrow can find little alleviation even in the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
of affection and friendship. It must wait for
time and trust and Christian faith to do their
offices for it.</p>

<p>“Nor do we derive anything of substantial
consolation from the spiritual philosophy. For
myself I do not feel the need of it to assure me
of the continuity of life—that my mother still
lives and loves us. All I now ask for is the
serene and beautiful child-like trust which has
made holy and pleasant the passage of our dear
mother. I no longer ask for <i>sight</i>—I feel that
<i>faith</i> is better. But I can only speak for myself.
Others may find solace and comfort in what
appears to them to be a communication direct
and certain with the loved ones who have
entered into the new life....</p>

<p>“Our neighbors have been very kind and considerate.
We miss thee very much,” he goes
on to say, “especially these long winter evenings
when it is very hard for us to sit alone with our
thoughts. Elizabeth seems quite overworn
and exhausted; but I hope is slowly gaining—and
for myself I have been little better than sick
for the last six weeks. But I am very thankful
I was able to be with my mother to the last. I
find no real consolation in anything short of a
prayerful submission to the Divine Providence....
Elizabeth sends thee her love and hopes
soon to write thee herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>Shortly after the death of his sister Elizabeth,
this same friend was most desirous to give the
poet direct evidence that it was possible to
communicate with spirits from another world.
Such proof was difficult to her sincere nature
unable to avail itself of shadowy methods, therefore
lacking mediumistic powers.</p>

<p>But one day in the garden room she was
making the experiment, the poet listening with
the deepest interest. He was of the mind of
Mortimer in “Henry the Fourth,” who when
Glendower boasted to him, “I can call spirits
from the vast deep,” retorted, “Why, so can I;
and so can any man. But will they <i>come</i> when
you do call for them?” The spiritualist, however,
was full of hope, and was beginning to
believe that some revelation was to be vouch-safed
to her—when, suddenly, she ceased all
effort and became her natural self.</p>

<p>“I can do nothing,” she announced. “The
spirits will not come. An unbeliever is near.”</p>

<p>Whittier was not amazed at the reticence of
the spirits. All that he wondered at as he told
the story was how his companion had devined
the approaching footsteps to be—as they
proved—those of a strong disbeliever in spiritualism,
although a firm believer in spirituality.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Yet everything which held a possibility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
throwing light upon the unknown world had the
greatest interest for Whittier.</p>

<p>One evening going to the doctor’s house, he
found the elders of the family out of town. The
poet seated himself for a few moments—possibly
not to disappoint the young people who
welcomed his coming.</p>

<p>“If you’ll stay, Mr. Whittier,” said one of
them, “we’ll have ‘planchette’.” For that
magic and impish toy, as it was then considered,
was at the time at the zenith of its fame. Today
it bears the name of “ouija.”</p>

<p>Up sprang the poet and whipped off his overcoat.
A table was cleared. Paper, of which
planchette required a lavish supply, was brought.
And the poet and the only member of the family
capable of coaxing anything out of planchette
sat down to the witchy little instrument which
then as today aroused wondering questions.</p>

<p>It was upon its good behavior that evening
and poured forth voluble answers. While in
general most unreliable, at times it did seem to
have a power of divination. All the autumn
of that year a “fire-bug,” still at large and undiscovered,
had been doing great damage in the
neighboring city of Newburyport. That evening
planchette, after many aliases, did actually give
a name which, later, proved to be that of the
criminal. Whittier was vastly entertained with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the whole performance; and—most unusual
with him—it was approaching the large hours
of the night when he went home.</p>

<p>But as he rose from the table, he revealed the
extent of his faith in the powers of the tricksy
little toy. Turning to his coadjutor, he said
to her:</p>

<p>“If thee can write planchette as well as that,
thee can write a book.”</p>

<p>But she never did.</p>

<p>The next instant Whittier had gone—after
the manner of his flittings.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But he met in a different vein something which
seemed to its narrator a hint from the spirit
world—a dream which had come to her after
the death of her father. In this dream she had
seen him standing, a vision of health and
beauty, beside the double of himself lying in
last agony. He had looked down upon the
suffering form as if he himself were no longer
one with it; and to emphasize this had thrown
a covering over the dead face. This dream had
been twice repeated with only slight variations.</p>

<p>Whittier listened with eager interest; and
then turning to the narrator, he said impressively:</p>

<p>“That was a good dream. I think that was
sent to comfort thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>The poet would sometimes talk of the relations
of those gone to another world to their dear
ones still here; and would wonder if the departed
knew of sorrow or loss to them—or, still worse, of
sin in the earth-bound ones whom they watched.
Yet, if this were so, he said, their outlook into
the future must be larger than ours, or their
faith much greater; and so, they would perceive,
or believe, that all would yet be well.</p>

<p>In memory of the dear ones gone before,
Whittier was desirous to buy back the old birthplace
in Haverhill. To his friend, Colonel F——,
conducting the negotiations for him, he wrote:</p>

<p>“I would leave it to any three competent
judges of property in the neighborhood to fix a
price, if we could not agree among ourselves.”</p>

<p>The purchase, however, fell through on account
of the unreasonable price demanded. The
owners reckoned upon Whittier’s vanity in
desiring to get possession of the scene of “Snow-Bound.”</p>

<p>But the poet was full of thoughtfulness of
what his money should do for others. Long
before the possibility of this purchase came to
him, he used to say that a great part of the land
in the old farm was “only good to help to hold
the world together.” In his letter desiring to
buy the property he stated that the part he
wanted was about the poorest part of the farm.
“And the house to anybody but myself,” he
added, “would be only valuable as firewood.”</p>

<p>After his death the birthplace was bought
by “The Whittier Homestead Association”
which has its membership among lovers of
Whittier in Haverhill and elsewhere. The care
bestowed upon it and the many pilgrims who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
journey to it prove the house of greater value
to his admirers than to the poet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If anything in Whittier showed, pre-eminently,
the quality of his soul, it was his absolute loyalty.
His allegiance once given, he was always true,
whether to person or to cause. The friends of
his earlier days lost none of their dearness when
wide fame and comparative wealth opened the
world to him. His old companions seemed to
be to him a part of the old family life that he
cherished so unremittingly. In life he loved
them; and he always carried in his heart the
friends who had passed beyond the veil.</p>

<p>“The sudden death of one of my oldest friends,
J. T. Fields, was a great shock to me,” he wrote.
“For forty years we have been very intimate.
No man save thy father has ever seemed nearer
to me. It is very strange to outlive so many of
my dear friends.” Of still another he says:
“Thus our loved ones pass on. I at least shall
soon follow.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>His letters are full of thought of those dear to
him here or in the world beyond. About three
years before his death he said in one of these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been miserably ill in August and
September and have not been able to read or
write much. My eyes fail me and I cannot use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
them without pain. I have thought a great
deal of thy father during my illness. I shall
never see a ‘beloved physician’ like him. When
I was in C—— the only visit I made was to the
house where he lived,” [in former days].
Elsewhere he says again: “Reading Miss Jewett’s
new book, “A Country Doctor,” I could not help
thinking of thy dear father. I have never ceased
to miss him and have always been thankful that
I was permitted to know and love him.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Don’t work too hard, too continuously,” he
advised a young friend. “I have not been able
for years to write more than half an hour at a
time because I wrote too steadily long ago. My
work, however, is nearly done. I am feeling
what old age is more and more, pain, loneliness,
and failing powers. But I have no right to
complain. For the many blessings which remain
I am very grateful, not the least of which
is the love of my friends.”</p>

<p>Later, he wrote: “I can say but little for
myself. The cold, wet season has been hard
for me and has made me very sensible that I am
old. I have little strength. Everything tires
me. After writing a letter or seeing company,
I feel exhausted.</p>

<p>“I am here [in Amesbury] at the election, and
am glad of the result. I shall probably go back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
to Danvers soon. I dread the coming winter.
But all will be as God wills and that will be
best.”</p>

<p>But neither age nor illness made him neglect
his vote.</p>

<p>Later, regretting a friend’s illness, he says:</p>

<p>“There is so much to be done in this world
and so many of us are unable to take our part
in the work our hands find to do.”</p>

<p>Again, he dreads the winter. “I wait for it
in no defiant mood,” he says, “I can scarcely
imagine that I am the same person who used to
welcome it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A band of colored singers whom the Hampton
Institute had trained to delight Northern ears
with their music, came to the poet at Oak Knoll,
and standing about him with a reverence born
of their knowledge of what he had been to their
race, they sang to him.</p>

<p>As the poet listened he was filled with remembrances
of the days of slavery and the contrast
of their present freedom and hope, and wept
in gratitude and joy.</p>

<p>Happily, the length and sufferings marking
the upward road of the race were concealed from
him.</p>

<p>“I go to Amesbury this week,” wrote the poet
from Oak Knoll in one of his later years, “to
attend our Quarterly Meeting there [the
Quarterly Meeting of the Friends]. “I have
not been very well this spring; but the east
winds must be nearly over and I hope I shall feel
better.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we all need to feel our weakness
and dependence upon our Father,” he added, in
answer to his correspondent, “and that it is well
for us to find ourselves walking the Valley of
Humiliation; but I like the hills and the sunshine,
after all.” And the hills and the sunshine
of joy were what he liked to lead others to
when he could.</p>

<p>With his invincible diffidence as to his own
work, he spoke of “My poem in the ‘Atlantic,’”
deprecating its merit but referring to it as a
sad revelation of “the old time.”</p>

<p>He had written before in the same strain of
another of his poems there.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One day there came to him at Oak Knoll a
person who had known him long and well but
had recently done something thoughtlessly with
which she afterward perceived that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
reason to be offended. She had come to him
resolved to tell him of it, and believing that,
since he was so kind, this would not be hard to do.</p>

<p>But it was hard; and as after the greeting she
sat listening and saying little, the sense of her
own mistake grew upon her. How could she
bear it if he should lose confidence, even in her
judgment?</p>

<p>“There is something I have done in regard to
you, Mr. Whittier,” she began at last——“and
I’m afraid you’ll be angry with me,” she added
with a new fearfulness.</p>

<p>Instantly, he turned his face from the fire into
which he had been gazing and looked at her.
He read all her fears. His whole face softened.
His flashing eyes met hers.</p>

<p>“I shall not be angry long,” he answered; and
was silent, waiting.</p>

<p>But the glance, the perfect assurance of the
tone were more than comfort; they were comprehension
and the glad evidence of a trust too
firm to be lightly overthrown. And as she told
her story, freely now, it turned out that he had
known it, and in a moment by his tact and
judgment had righted everything she had feared
that she had tangled.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I have been unable to write for some weeks
except at rare intervals, as my eyes are failing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
me, and my general health and strength are so
diminished,” he wrote from Amesbury in the
May of 1889. “I never expect to write again
except an occasional note in private correspondence.
The mental effort of dictation which I
have tried is too hard for me. Phebe [the
adopted daughter of his cousin, Mrs. Woodman
at Oak Knoll] has tried to be my amanuensis,
but to little purpose. I can only read for a few
minutes without pain. I should not venture
to engage to write anything for the public. My
work is over—I can do no more, but must
silently wait for the end which cannot be far
off. Letter after letter meanwhile comes to me
which I cannot answer, and people come to see
me whom I cannot talk with.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Yet he rallied his strength. For it was after
this letter that the last beautiful message of his
poems—“At Sundown”—printed and not
published at that time, was sent out by him in
greeting to his friends.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whatever his weakness and weariness of body,
his prayer,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let my last days be my best,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">was answered. For the soul in him was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
shining “light that shineth more and more
unto the perfect day.”</p>

<p>After his recovery from “grippe” with which
he had been dangerously ill, the writer held a
long conversation with him at the home of his
cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Cartland of Newburyport.</p>

<p>In this conversation he seemed in clearness of
vision, wideness of range, strength and grasp
of subject, and especially in a certain energy, to
carry her back to his days of comparative bodily
vigor. All that his soul had had or held, it had
and held more firmly than ever, and it had
gained that higher outlook spread before the
eyes of him whose feet are upon the mountains.</p>

<p>Not only did Whittier believe in immortality,
but his very presence helped others to believe
in it.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And all the windows of my heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I open to the day,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">sang the poet when through time and trial
somewhat of the rest of eternity had come to
him and in the beginning of age—that youth
of immortality—he could say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... all the jarring notes of life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seem blending in a psalm.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With all the elements so mixed in him—pride,
power, ambition, indignation against
wrong, intense love of liberty, keenness in
character-reading, political acumen, delight in
beauty, with humor illuminating all it lighted
upon—and not inclined to overlook anything—we
find in many-sided Whittier nothing more
strongly marked than praise of all things good,
which flows inevitably into worship of the
Giver. For simplicity is not at all one idea; it
is one purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I am a Quaker because my family before
me—those whom I loved—were Quakers,”
he said one day to his guest who had accompanied
him to the Friends’ meeting and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
returning sat in the garden room listening to
his comments. “And also I am one because the
faith pleases me,” he continued. “I believe in
it.”</p>

<p>In the May of 1886, only six years before his
death, the poet wrote:</p>

<p>“I hope thee are able to enjoy this beautiful
springtime better than I can. I have been laid
up with a cold for the last fortnight, and I have
reached an age when I cannot afford to take cold
at all. I hope to be able to go to Amesbury in
season for Quarterly Meeting which I have
never missed.”</p>

<p>He had never missed the Quarterly Meeting
of the Friends—he at almost forescore and
having always been so delicate in health!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was wonderful that Whittier with his
delicate health, his many illnesses, his extreme
sensitiveness, even to the winds of heaven when
they did not blow from the right quarter, should
have fought through and helped to win a great
battle for the freedom of millions of human
beings.</p>

<p>Still more wonderful was it that he should
have lived for almost a generation after this was
won, to enjoy the fruits of his victory and of
his genius. In 1883 he said in a letter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Many years ago a Boston doctor of eminence
told me that I had disease of the heart. But if
that had been so, I should not have been alive
now.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>More than the absence of positive disease,
however, upheld his strength. It was that
constant renewal of vital force which comes
from living in the Spirit, united with that same
wise judgment in the management of his frail
body that marked his course in all matters.</p>

<p>He voices this renewal of vitality when in
“Our Master,” he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We touch him in life’s throng and press,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And we are whole again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They who have seen Whittier suddenly
arrested in speech and action stand motionless
with bent head and listening soul, and then for
a moment uplift his face, his eyes glowing with
inspiration, as if his own soul were sending back
a message to the skies, can never doubt that
there were moments when in the language of
the prophets whom he loved, “an angel spake
to him.”</p>

<p>Or was it that the heart of the Father Himself—the
“Over-Heart,” as the poet has it—called
to his heart?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>Later, the poet would speak the message he
had received. But the fullness, the joy of it no
man could utter—unless he spoke in the tongue
of Heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was in the garden room where the eyes of
one who sat by in reverence had seen this bowed
head, this look listening and rapt, this flashing
upward glance responsive with joy and power,
that the poet sat discoursing of many things of
life and thought. In speaking of a creed—belief
in the hard and fast-bound fate of all who
did not reach what human beings considered the
standard of faith—he said:</p>

<p>“If people really believed all the things that
they think they believe concerning God and the
future judgment of the lost, there would be no
more smiling in the world.”</p>

<p>Yet no one could be farther from underestimating
the danger of slighting human responsibility
than was Whittier. His oft-repeated saying,
“The Lord will do the best He can for us,” to
Whittier always carried with it the certainty
that God would respect man’s choice. It was
linked with the poet’s assertions, “It’s better not
to risk behaving in this world as if there were no
other,” and, “We ought to do the best we can
in this world.”</p>

<p>The intensity of this conviction he utters in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
his “Tent on the Beach,” where he speaks of
taking in the crowded sail and letting his conscience
steer—the conscience, not of a bigot,
but of a saint.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Poet, philanthropist, saint, as he was—and
not scientist—no man comes closer to that
supreme science which is perception of the
highest truths. That the love of the Father is
unalterable, and the free choice of man inalienable,
brings to his mind all the possibilities of
endless sinning and suffering, side by side with
the mercy that endures forever. In its vivid
portrayal of Divine love rejected, his poem,
“The Answer,” is one of the most remarkable
religious poems of the language. In it he sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No force divine can love compel.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No word of doom may shut thee out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No wind of wrath may downward whirl,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No swords of fire keep watch about</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The open gates of pearl;</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A tenderer light than moon or sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Than song of earth a sweeter hymn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May shine and sound forever on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And thou be deaf and dim.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For ever round the Mercy-seat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The guiding lights of Love shall burn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But what if, habit-bound, thy feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shall lack the will to turn?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In such mood one day in the garden room the
talk led up to the story of Lazarus and Dives,
to the selfish luxury in which the latter had
lived, his hard-heartedness, his terrible punishment,
and in Hades his cry for mercy, if not for
himself, yet for his brothers. After uttering
many things of deepest interest, the poet sat
silent with head bent and eyes upon the flower
flame which he loved so well, and which in some
way seemed to inspire him. Suddenly, he turned
upon his hearer, his eyes kindled into splendor
by the glow of his thought which flashed upon
him and burst into instant speech.</p>

<p>“He would not stay there long,” he said of
Dives; “he had begun to think of his brothers!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two visitors came to the poet’s house one day
and while waiting for him to appear, one of
them picked up the poem, “The Eternal Goodness,”
then just published, and reading it aloud
remarked, “Whittier could not have written
that thirty years ago.”</p>

<p>It was true. As Whittier’s feet had climbed the
steeps of self-sacrifice, the horizon of the Eternal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
had ever widened before his eyes. Many men
has he trained in faith and leadership.</p>

<p>For while men’s minds struggled with questions
as to the mind and methods of God,
Whittier from the Spirit within him sang of the
heart of God. Neither mete nor bound of creed
could hold him whose communion was with the
Spirit itself. His last message—“Love to all the
world,” was the seal of those years of spiritual
communion with Him who came to save the
world.</p>

<p>In recalling those inspired poems, “The Eternal
Goodness,” and “Our Master,” the remark he
made one day to the writer becomes of especial
interest.</p>

<p>“I asked Emerson,” said Whittier, as he sat
talking beside the flower-filled hearth in the
garden room, “doesn’t thee believe that Christ
was more than other men—than mere human?”
“Yes,” Emerson answered. “Then I said to
him,” continued Whittier, “If thee does, thee
ought to confess it in thy writings.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“His eye was beauty’s powerless slave,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whittier most truly sings of himself.</p>

<p>For never a fair and beautiful thing of earth
in his pathway was unseen by him; and never
one did he pass by, save at the command which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
led him to higher beauty. No indifference or
coldness, no lack of fervor or of sympathy
marred his high nature. His poems are full of
belief in the immanence of the Spirit that to
him was no vague and distant Effulgence, but
a present Companion.</p>

<p>This vision of Reality through the mists which
clothe the seeming real was so vivid that to him
every mountain was a possible Mount of Transfiguration
needing but the revelation of the One
always present to show forth its splendor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Whittier is inspirer in patriotism, in honor, in
holiness; comforter in distress and sorrow. To
those who believe in the sacredness of a righteous
cause, who hold their country’s honor high;
to those who would listen to the voice of Nature
in her true and deepest moods; to those who
love</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All sweet accords of hearts and homes;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">—and more—to those who mourn their dead,
or who sorrow over sins and seek the promise of
the Father’s love—to all these when life’s
strain is greatest Whittier declares that Reality
which the soul craves.</p>

<p>In the sins, distresses, and sorrows overwhelming
the world today, Whittier’s life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
work stand forth filled with the strength builded
upon Eternity. With inspiration he sings to
the word:</p>
